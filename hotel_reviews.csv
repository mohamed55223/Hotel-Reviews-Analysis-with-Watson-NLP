Hudson Hotel,Nov 26 2009 ,Great Hotel!,"We stayed at the Hudson Hotel for 5 nights and after reading a lot of bad reviews was very pleased with the hotel. Rooms were very clean and although small, bigger than I was expecting. Perfect location within walking distance to Times Square and 5th Avenue. Had a great stay here and would definately reccommend it!!!"
Hudson Hotel,Nov 25 2009 ,Great Hotel in Great Location,"I just spent 3 days at the Hudson Hotel and highly recommend it! The room was clean, (a bit small) the bed was comfortable and the hotel is a great mix of trendy and urban chic. the lobby is fun and interesting, exposed brick and and ivy on the walls and ceiling. the front desk and concierge staff were polite and accomodating. the housekeeping staff, always smiled and said good morning. The gym was well appointed with good equipment and a friendly staff member. The location was excellent close to most subway lines, it was an easy trip to rockefeller center, central park, lincoln center, and the upper west side. An added plus was its proximity to the Time Warner center with great shopping, restaurants and of course a great Whole Foods-for an early morning juice!Great value compared to other NYC hotels I have previously stayed!I definitely recommend the hudson!I almost forgot, the Hudson Bar, a chic loungy kind of place to enjoy a drink."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 24 2009 ,tiny rooms - GREAT PRICES,"no sign outside = difficult to find: we walked by three times without finding the entranceenormous lobby with nearly no light and hectic music foregroundtiny room: - nearly could not get up and down from the toilet and turn around in bathroom- impossible to be in two people without continuosly stepping out of the way- banging doors - loud neighbourhood in the night--- in case you want a room with little more space you pay much more: I paid plus $68.86 for 25% more room for one night, what edded up to $244.81 (weekend low)"
Hudson Hotel,Nov 22 2009 ,Beautiful lobby tiny room,"The hotel was unmarked from the front, but inside had an absolutely goregous lobby and entrance area. Bellman and front desk staff were very helpful. Room was trendy and clean but exceptionally TINY. Even bathtub and toilet were minature. Hallways were very dark which I didnt love. We only stayed one night but had no issues with room being loud, etc. I would return, but for the price would probably pick a hotel with a little more space."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 22 2009 ,Totally sleepless night!,"I took my husband to NYC for his birthday for a 1-night getaway. We got a good promotional price for our room, which is the only reason we would have chosen this hotel because we knew up front that the room were quite small for a pretty big pricetag. It is, however, a nice place with some funky characteristics and the room size was not a major issue as we didn't plan to spend a lot of time there. The only size-related problem was that the bathroom was so small that my husband (who is 6' 4&quot;) could barely use the toilet! Anyway, that would have been fine, and the hotel's location is great. The major problem is that we were put in a 10th floor room overlooking 57th St. and subsequently did not sleep AT ALL the entire night. Despite being 10 floors up, the room was so poorly sound-proofed that we could hear every car go by, and ceaseless amounts of car horns beeping all night long. Add in the occasional ambulance or police siren and some groups of people yelling at eachother at all hours, and it was a sleepless night that really put a huge damper on our NYC experience. If you do choose to stay here, absolutely insist on an atrium-facing room or one higher up, and/or check it out first to see how the noise level seems BEFORE you attempt to go to sleep! Very disappointing."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 20 2009 ,Trendy!,"I stayed here this week while visiting my fiancee while he was on business. The location of the Hudson hotel is super convenient to Columbus Circle, Central Park and Time Square. This hotel is super trendy and modern. It was quite a refreshing change from the typical Holiday Inn. The hotel is not marked from the outside so it can be difficult to find. The valet service is superb. Upon entering the hotel, there is a long neon green escalator to the impressive lobby-all exposed brick and glass covered with ivy. The hotel has quite an exclusive bar which can be accessed with your hotel privilege card you receive upon check in. I hear that without the card, it's tough to get in unless you are dressed well. This week the Victoria Secret models were staying there while in town for a fashion show. Needless to say...the bar was quite busy. I myself skipped it as:a. I'm not a big drinkerb. I DO NOT look like a vickys modelc. I am intimidatedThe floors of the hotel are dark and drab communist block gray. I found it very stylish and enjoyed the decor. The rooms are small...yes its true!!! But people: this is NYC!!!!!! You are paying for space!!! I felt the room size was completely appropriate and we were staying in a standard room built for 1 person (my fault since I surprised my honey with the visit..he was not expecting me). The inside of the rooms are wood paneled. The bed is modern and comparable to any European hotel. I enjoyed this. I hate American hotel bedding and when Americans complain I think they are ridiculous (and I am an American!). I absolutely loved the glass wall separating the room from the shower. It allows for a fun peep show! Also the lights in the room are fantastic. It was fun figuring out the many ways to turn them all on. The road noise from outside is awful. Trucks were honking and there was constant noise all night. Also, the walls are paper thin. The only way to properly close the doors is to slam them...therefore loud slamming doors all night. Also, the light from the hallway is very bright in the room. Overall, a fun experience in a cool hotel but did not allow for a super restful night's sleep."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 19 2009 ,I've stayed in nicer hostels,"This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Would definitely not recommend for business travel. I would only recommend to people who want to spend as little time as possible in the actual room and who are there to party. The hotel is all lobby and bar, every floor smells like the pool (I don't think there even is one in the hotel). The light from the hallway shines in through the cracks in the door, there is no top sheet on the bed, there is no mini bar, the TV is mounted on a mirror, and there was a window from the shower to the room. The worst part was when the front desk corrupted all of the files on my USB drive."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 16 2009 ,Do not stay here!,"This hotel has a lovely lobby and an excellent location. The decor is nice and the Library Bar and Hudson Bar are both very welcoming. However, I was there for three nights and they put me in three rooms trying to find one that had a livable temperature. The first room started out at 60 degrees and then they fixed it. After that it was 86 degrees and would not get cooler. The heating/cooling unit blew hot air no matter what the thermostat was set to. The next room had a heating/cooling unit that would not work. If you turned it on the thing would make loud clanking noises all night. We left it off and they moved us to a new room the next day. That room was 74-78 degrees with the heat off. If you tried to turn the AC on, the air was luke warm and did nothing to cool the room. Also, this room was on the top floor and much larger. However, the water in the bathroom was rust colored each time you turned it on. It was a shame because the location was terrific and I really liked what they were going for in the space. You can find something more reliable if you look and, in the end, the concept was not worth the unreliable service and lack of comfort."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 15 2009 ,Tiny cramped needs renovation,"This hotel was, I'm sure, designed to be hip and chic. Maybe it once was. Now however, it is bordering on shabby and feels tired and worn out. The rooms are like postage stamps. I'm 6'2&quot; and my hands hit the ceiling as I changed my shirt. There was a low platform double bed with a foot or two around the bed and that constituted the size of the room. There were water stains on the ceiling, no toilet paper and the window that was supposed to open was not operating. The elevators are tiny, have a long wait and check out constitutes a half hour wait for one. I recommend avoiding this hotel if there are any other viable options."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 15 2009 ,Bring A Torch!,v trendy and v dark! met lots of fellow brits groping their way round the walls. particularly amused to be in the library - too dark to read! good location near the columbus circle so from that point of view it works but wouldn't rush back.
Hudson Hotel,Nov 14 2009 ,Very nice,"Close to Columbus Circle, the localization is pretty good and the hotel looks really nice, with fair rates. "
Hudson Hotel,Nov 12 2009 ,Better than expected,"Our experience was much better than we expected having read some of the reviews. Yes the rooms were small, but this is typical for the price in NYC. The staff was much friendlier than other hotels I've stayed in. No sign outside so look for the small square windows shown on the hotels website, We did not eat or drink in the hotel. Enjoy."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 9 2009 ,terrible,"I've been in Hudson many times before and for some reason this time I really felt it will be the last time for sure. If you look at the hallways and the carpets are really dirty, restaurant was closed due to renovation, breakfast was served in the bar and they didn't have bred to offer. Over priced definitely and yes the rooms are SMALL! OMG in the toilet/restroom you can't even sit in the toilet its that bad. Oh and yes its a party hotel so be aware of the bouncers which are everywhere in the hotel even in our floor they booked one elevator for some &quot;special&quot; guest so it took like 15 minutes to get down. Again I don't want to sound like a douche but this was definitely the worst stay I have had and before I recommended the place but that time is over."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 4 2009 ,"The room was tiny and overpriced; the ""suite"" to which we upgraded was not much better.","The standard room is only large enough for a double bed, with insufficient space to walk around it. I've seen larger jail cells. We upgraded, for an additional $120/night, to what was descibed as a suite. It had the same double bed, 1950's style rec room wood paneling on the walls and no dresser. I find it hard to believe anyone would knowingly stay at this hotels at the prices which it charges for its rooms."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 2 2009 ,TINY roomscool decor...recommend if you don't have to pay full price,"-The rooms are just as pictured...tiny but okay if you are only sleeping. Not much room for luggage and one steel ,uncomfortable chair.Room clean and nice linens,no bathrobe as advertised.Friendly staff.Sky terrace closed even though it was in the low60's.Lobby cool,but dark and loud at night, although did not disturb sleep. Just no place to really sit down and relax.Cafeteria closed for renovations during our stay...complimentary coffee from the breakfast buffet was nice. Also offered umbrella's for use when it rained which was nice. We got a really good deal through Priceline......would not have been happy if we had paid full price."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 2 2009 ,Style over comfort,"Great lobby but standrard room is extremely small, cools style but not comfortable. Not suited for business traveler; no easy outlet for laptop, &quot;desk&quot; is tiny, no comforable chair, metal desk chair is the only chair in the room"
Hudson Hotel,Nov 1 2009 ,clean hotel would stay again,"i searched ALOT for hotels in new york for a trip for me and three friends. i checked out hudson hotel on tripadvisor and there snazzy website! and booked two double rooms for four of us. but then got a fright as there was a video on youtube from a guy showing the room .and said it was the smallest room ever.. but the pictures on the website are exactly what the rooms look like which is good! the room is CLEAN and NEW! i loved the contemporary design of the room. but it is small (they give you the measurements on the website)when you have all your suitcases.but manageable. it is a perfect room for jus sleeping and not hanging around in! the shower nice too and clean . theres a flatscreen tv and ipod dock .handy!inside the hotel u never know wat time it is as it has loads of dim lighting. but loved the design. at nighttime when we would come back they would have loud music in the bar at the lobby. but u cant hear anything in your room! i think they have alot of functions there. but it didnt bother us at all. our window did fall out !!! we put it back and told the reception .and they took money off our bill.there was one girl at front desk, not the smilest but didnt really care!girl who checked us out was lovely. the location was good too. right at culumbus circle subway-across the street. theres deli, supermarket, pharmacy, starbuck etc... on the block. and the best thing ever.wholefoods supermarket was in the shopping centre near the subway. really cheap gorgeous food. if u on a budget! its right near walking to central park .broadway , rockafella, time sq. get subway downtownoh yea, wifi in room was like ten dollars a day .. rip off!! and we bought fon card to ring our friends in new york and they charged for using the fon card..im not uploading my pics as theyy wer reallly lik the website ones.."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 30 2009 ,Terrible and nobody cared,"I recently stayed at the Hudson for a night because the hotel I was booked for the rest of the weekend (Parker Meridien) was not available for the rest of the weekend. When I arrived I was told that the room I booked was not available and that they &quot;Downgraded me&quot; . Now I travel a lot for business and am used to the occasional &quot;upgrade&quot; but have never heard of a downgrade. I was told that was all they had unless I wanted to pay for an upgrade.When we got into the room it wasn't even a double bed, it was somewhere between a single and double. The manager was indifferent but finally gave us a larget but still small room. Without telling us they raised our rate however. The room was still very small and not at all nice.The funny part is that they sent me a survey, I completed it terribly and they didn't call to follow-up but they still add me to their mailing list. I asked to be taken off and they didn't do it, finally I called to complain to their headquarters and they didn't respond or take me off their mailing list still!Bottom line, Stay at the Parker, it was excellent!"
Hudson Hotel,Oct 29 2009 ,Great Stay,"ok so the rooms are small, i wasn't planning to spend any time there. The rest of the hotel and its amenities make up for it. Its exciting vibe and since i was there alone it worked out well that there were a couple bars in the hotel that i can hang out at... Great place."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 28 2009 ,Mini-Vaca,"This was my first time staying in an NYC hotel alone, normally at a friends or with family. I read the reviews good &amp; bad, but i had a pretty decent stay. I really liked the dark entrance, and hallways...added a touch of cool. I will say that the lobby was a bit hectic after 9pm, but i was there to party and shop....so i didnt mind. Especially after being invited to a private party in the club. The room was small...but honestly who goes to NYC to sit in a hotel room. Just enough room to sleep, rest, shower and change clothes. The only thing i didnt like was the 300$ deposit they just slap on your card when you check in. Another thing was that my room key kept gettin demagnetized, i had to get a new key twice....one of those 2 times, i had to wait almost 30mins in line just for a key. Overall it was a nice stay, but they could work on customer service speed."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 28 2009 ,HORRIBLE HOTEL,"I live and work in NYC. I stayed at the Hudson one night because it was close to an event I needed to be at very early in the AM. DO NOT STAY HERE!!! The rooms were horribe. They were tiny (much smaller than your average NYC hotel for the same rate) and the rooms did not have city windows. If you are from NYC you know what city windows are. They are double windows that keep the sound out. They chinsed out and didn't put them in. The room was so noisy that I might as well have slept on the street. Don't be fooled by pictures. The bars are cool and I have been to the bars numerous times. I thought the hotel would be OK. MY MISTAKE. I slept about 2 hours. If you like the pics go to the bar, but definetly STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 28 2009 ,Quirky!,"Spent 4 nights at the Hudson - recommended by our travel agent. Arrived late evening - I suppose our taxi driver knew it well as it had no indication from the roadside that it was the Hudson. Lobby and reception is at the end of a fluorescent green escalator from the roadside. Lobby and reception were dark and moody with lots of dark wood everywhere. Dark corridor lead to the library bar and access to courtyard garden/seating area (outside). Checked in in about 3 minutes. Room on the 4th floor. What strikes you first is the size of the room - quite small by comparison with other US cities. A white net curtain was drawn between the entrance area and bed area. More dark wood panelling, dark wooden floor. Interesting bathroom. Very small but functional. A large glass partition between shower and bed area could lead for interesting views but the shower curtain and net curtain mask any views you might have. Be careful sitting down on the toilet not to bang your head on the wall 3 inches infront of you! Comfortable bed, but air con noisy at times (but not excessively). Bedside lamps can be swivelled to show a white or a green light - nice. Flat screen TV, CD/radio and ipod docking station all available in room. No mini bar, but outside the elevator doors were vending machines for food, drinks (soft) and ice, all cheaper than traditional minibar prices.Breakfast can be taken in a large room just off the lobby that looks as if it was out of the last scenes of the movie 2001. Breakfast was expensive - we ate in one of 2 cafes 50 yards either side of the front entrance.Outside - turn right, is a shopping mall, then Columbus circle, and beyond that - Central Park.About a 15 minute walk to Times Square and the theatres. We saw Rock of Ages - 1980's rock music - very good, very funny - well worth a look.Had reservations for The View - revolving restaurant overlooking Times Square - beautiful food, attentive waiter, water $10 a bottle!Also had tickets for the Top of the Rock - Rockerfeller Centre. Similar to top of the Empire State - excellent views of Central Park, not so good of the Chrysler Building.Also visited Liberty Island. Be prepared for airport style security checks before you get on the ferry. No tickets for the crown of the statue - sold out till January we heard.Use the subways to get about - buy a Metrocard ticket from the machine in the subway - $8 for 4 rides, or share it between a couple. Fast, efficient, clean - no worries at all.Walked our legs off - blisters, but wonderful city to visit."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 28 2009 ,Find another hotel,"Our first room was on one the sixth floor so it was very very loud, loud enough that you couldn't sleep even with the window closed. The street outside constantly had people yelling, cars honking, garbage trucks banging. The room itself was tiny and there was mildew all over the ceiling. That's why we asked to be moved to another room higher up, which the hotel agreed to. While we were out in the city the hotel staff without our consent or presence went into our room and moved our belongings to another room. In the process my friend had her purse, shoes, make up, basically whatever was of value that was not locked up in the safe stolen. When we reported this to the &quot;security&quot; it was like talking to a wall and we were sent in circles where each staff referred us to another staff who referred us to another staff, until it was time to leave the hotel and go back home. How much luck do you think we had once we tried to get this looked into after coming home if they were useless while we were talking to them face to face. Do yourself a favor, find a reputable hotel even if it costs a little more or is a little out of the way."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 27 2009 ,Imagine the kids who work at Abercrombie having their own hotel.,"I have to say, this hotel was quite a disappointment. The housekeeping was lousy (never replacing dirty glasses), every bulb went out in our room over our week's stay, the bathroom is very tiny (you have to move aside from the door to open it), and it just felt amateur. If you are staying for more than a weekend, this is not the place.We had the feeling as if the &quot;cool&quot; kids who work at Abercrombie and Fitch decided, in Little Rascals' fashion, &quot;Hey gang, let's open a hotel!&quot;. If you like the bars (I did like the Library bar very much), stop by, but don't stay in the hotel. Not worth it. They should walk down the street to 6 Columbus (where we moved, and loved it) or the Mandarin Oriental to learn some basic Hotel 101."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 27 2009,An Absolute Joke,"Location: goodLobby : trendyRoom : absurd!How can this hotel get ANY stars? We booked a room for two. I was getting a bit worried when the hallway looked like what I imagine a NY state penitentary does, dark, dreary, grey. When we opened the door and almost hit the bed, I knew we were in trouble. You would have to walk sideways to get into the &quot;bed&quot;,and I use that term loosely. The top of the bed was below my knees. The bathroom made the airline bathrooms seem spacious. Another wonderful touch was the glass window between the bathroom and bedroom. Plastic cups, a bathroom sink that didn't drain, poor air circulation, paper thin walls, a business center that didn't work....do yourself a favor and book a motel 6. It would be a definite upgrade."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 26 2009,A Great Visual extravaganza,"The Phillip Stark design made the hotel quite unique. The outdoor bar, the library and the indoor bar with a painted ceiling, and all with quirky furniture, made for a very interesting shared space. The room was small but adequate- clean sheets and towels every day and friendly staff. There was a great view from the window on the 16th floor."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 25 2009 ,Small very small (and we are NYers),"Ok, so the reviews said the rooms were small and they weren't kidding. Our queen size room had maybe 2 feet of space around the perimeter of the bed... and that was it. Hudson Cafeteria... closed. Sky Terrace... closed. Library... too jam packed to even walk into it. Hudsons Bar... loud and young. We would rate the hotel as &quot;trendy&quot; for the 20-30 year old crowd. For those of us in our 40's, not really a place that we felt we wanted to spend much time in. The location was very convenient but would not have been very happy if we had paid regular prices as opposed to using Priceline. We would not go out of our way to stay here again."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 25 2009 ,Cool lobby  shoe box sized room,"I have stayed at The Hudson before merely because the price was right ($200). The positive attributes of The Hudson include an unique lobby, several nice bars including one on the roof, and ideal location if you are seeking to be near Columbus Avenue toward the bottom of Central Park. The major negative is the room size. Earlier in the same week I stayed at another 4 star major hotel chain in NYC and the room was three times the size for $60 more.I was traveling solo this trip for leisure and business. However, I couldn't help to think that if I was traveling with a partner how gravely disappointed I would be with the room. It is cramped and if you are tall or a larger sized person I believe you would find the bathroom a challenge to move around in. There is also nothing romantic about the rooms. They are modern, sparse, and have dark wood paneling. One nice touch is the iPod docking station. Staying here twice now, both times I had small rooms. This last time though it was exceptionally small. I knew this going in and if price point is a consideration and room size does not matter to you, then The Hudson is a fine choice. If you are looking for a pleasant room with some walking space and / or a hotel that is comfortable and perhaps a nice get away with your partner, I would not recommend The Hudson. If value and location matter to you and room size does not, then this would be a logical choice."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 22 2009 ,Designed by Starck = Minimalist = Bedrooms Plus VERY DARK,On arrival - austere frontage and entrance (no name on building) escalator leads to large but very dark lobby area. Helpful Staff - (especially concierges who were first class - in particularly Brian) Corridors on each floor to rooms painted DARK BROWN! - Rooms = VERY small. Even after upgrade still small plus NO DRAWERS = Live out of a suitcase !!!!!Heating switched in through the night every two hours - Waking everyone up plus what sounded like someone running a stick against a railing!Others mentioned curtains - they were lucky! For us just blinds but draft from windows quite severe. Great location - spoiled by the size of the rooms and VERY dark decor everywhere - (including restaurant where two candles had to be put on table - just to read menu!).Good external 'roof terrace' behind reception - spolit by 'cocky' barman stating couldn't sit out with drinks!!!!
Hudson Hotel,Oct 20 2009 ,Just o.k. -- great location nice rooms ,"Great location. Attentive staff, nicely appointed rooms and public spaces. Had a problem with the heat (pumped out lava-hot air even with the thermostat set at 60 degrees). I eventually gave up, shut off the thermostat and opened a window (which wasn't functioning, so I propped it open with a towel). Lots of street noise relative to other NYC hotels (even on 14th floor with window shut). Colleagues had similar issues with noise from adjacent rooms and temperature control/"
Hudson Hotel,Oct 19 2009 ,Great location,"If you want to stay in a central location while visiting Manhattan then this is the place for you. The hotel is located less then a block from the Columbus Circle subway stop. If you are traveling in from JFK airport the subway is the only way to go. Catch the Airtrain to Howard Beach then catch the A train subway from Howard Beach to Columbus Circle (59th Street). Buy your $7.25 Metrocard ($5 Airtrain, $2.25 subway) at the subway station after you exit the Airtrain but before you get on the subway. If you are traveling with more then one person you can purchase one ticket for up to 4 people. If you do this, the first person can swipe the card up to 4 times and the rest of your party can walk right through.If you are traveling with two people and don’t mind snug quarters then get one of the smaller rooms. If you are traveling with more then 2 people get a double. We traveled with three adults and had plenty of room in a double. You pay more for the bigger room but well worth the money. Located next to the hotel is a Europan cafe. You can get great breakfast or a late night snack. There are two great pubs around the corner on W 57th Street (one block away) Kennedy’s and DJ Reynolds. Both are good for food and drinks and a very easy walk. Central Park is just a block away and Times Square is within walking distance. If you have a good map you will see this hotel is in a great location. It’s not fancy, but a clean and easy way to get around Manhattan."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 19 2009 ,Great Location,"We stayed here for 4 nights and had a great time, even though the rooms are small they are very well laid out and ours was spotless. Brilliant decor in reception and even though the night club is very loud when you are in the lobby we didn't hear a thing in our bedroom. The restaurant was a little too dark, difficult to read the menu, but the food was great. I would defintely stay here again."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 14 2009 ,Rooms need a refurb badly - you will be dissapointed!,"I stayed here recently and upon arrival I have to say it lived up to my expectations. Public areas are stunning , however it was all downhill after that or more that a fifty foot drop into hotel room hell. Firstly despite being after check in time, my room wasn't ready, no problem I was happy to wander off and have a coffee and come back later. When I returned back they had accidentally given my room to someone else with the same surname but no problem they had another one. Great. Then I checked into it. My god. I had booked a room for 2 people, myslef and my sister and the new room was a single occpancy room which they were trying to pass of as a double. First clue was the 1 bed which was not even a double and the fact that the room was set up with 1 towel and 1 glass etc. when I called down to complain I was greeting with an attitude of sorry that's our style this is a double room. Hmmm nothing to do woth the fact they made a mistake. After 3 phonecalls and a trip to reception to finally track down teh guest manager I was moved to a room suitable for 2. Great. Nope. Drawers were broken and the shower pressure was so bad it was like a dripping tap not to mention teh orange mould encasing the shower head. I mentioned the shower politely to the recpetion who said &quot;oh yeah we have issues with water pressure - sorry nothing we can do&quot;. Overall this hotel is nothing more than a cocktail bar with bedrooms that are 2-3 star at a stretch. Sorry Hudson Hotel I will not be coming back nor will I be staying at any of your hotels ever again and I will tell as many people as possible how poor your standards are. Do yourself a favour and splash some of your profit on a room refurb plan and make your rooms live up to your reputation. At the very least scrub the shower and fix the water pressure."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 14 2009 ,Arrogant Trendy B.S.,"We stumped for one of the largest rooms #549. Still had to avoid banging my head on the TV to get out of bed. Questionable stain behind the toilet reported to housekeeping 3 times. Air con/Heat broken. Window cracked and 24/7 vent from main air duct from entire bldg outside the window. Shower drain blocked. Hole in wood flooring beside bed. Hallway carpet filthy. Waited 3 times for over an hour for engineering and they never came. $9 for a Heineken. And dark/no light at check-in. When I asked &quot;Ryan&quot; - he said that was his name what I was being asked to sign and initial, he said, &quot;well it's not like you're signing your life away&quot;. Shame on you Morgan Group. You know better. Viceroy LA and Hard Rock Vegas are well run. Maybe you should review your management staff at that location. We were there for 5 days with a large wedding party who spent plenty and we were still treated like dollars walking thru a revolving door. Pretentious has no place in this economy. I left a note 36 hrs ago with my email and phone on check out and no-one has even bothered to call me and apologize."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 14 2009 ,Tiny rooms but IKEA sensibility and Design Within Reach aesthetic make it work,"If you're looking for a super-chic centrally-located NYC hotel experience, but you're on a tight budget, the Hudson is the way to go. You can get in next to Columbus Circle (southwest corner of Central Park) for just over $200 -- a steal in that neighborhood and for this kind of hotel.You're greeted by one of the swankiest lobbies around, with a lounge decorated like the mystical outer space-time room at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. You can watch hipsters grind on the dance floor (we admit they were a sexy bunch), and the music is fun, but beware the drink tab -- two drinks cost $35 with tip (!).Even the elevator is cool -- we overheard three different groups commenting on how interesting the walls of the elevator were. (It's a cool metal pattern -- you'll have to visit to see what we mean.)The rooms are clean, neat, and well-decorated, with comfy beds.So how is this just over $200? Well, the rooms are tiny. Matchbox-sized. It brings Tokyo to mind. In our room there was barely enough space to walk around the bed, and the shower was a standup right next to the toilet and sink. But they make it work -- everything fits just so, with clever shelving and furniture configured so there's just enough room to shower, sit at the desk, move around the bed, and put your luggage down. So after you get over the initial &quot;wow, this is tiny&quot; shock, you'll be impressed at how well it works.Take it for a spin -- great for date trips, outings with friends, and for entertaining your favorite Euro-guest."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 13 2009 ,Chic Hotel,"The Hudson Hotel was a chic hotel. the rooms are cute but a little uncomfortable as they are VERY small. Realistically the bathroom is difficult to sit down on the toilet and not bang your knees on the wall. the minibar was taken out of the rooms and everything is located by the elevators and make sure you request a room that doesn't face the courtyard area becuase you can hear the noise at night from the bar. Otherwise the hotel is located in a great spot, across the street from Time Warner Center for shopping and Porterhouse a great steakhouse. Pinkberry and Starbucks are all down the street and a great sushi restaurant also on the same block. Would definately stay here again :)"
Hudson Hotel,Oct 13 2009 ,The Hudson is about the Property the room is just for sleeping...,"I really enjoyed the Hudson. There are a few reviews on here complaining about the room size at the Hudson, if you are going to be spending alot of time in your room and are looking for &quot;spacious quarters&quot; , the Hudson isn't for you. The Property, however, is brilliant, and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. With 3 Bars, one on the roof with amazing views, a nightclub thats open until at least 2AM and a Library Bar for something a bit more conservative, staying at the Hudson is kind of like moving into a very well appointed and service orientated nightclub and 5 star Restaurant! Having a comfortable but &quot;smaller&quot; room is quite an acceptable trade off to the properties overall comfort and services. I travel for business, so it's white collar by day and leather jacket at night, its awesome to know that when I get back to the Hudson, that the scene is a Hotspot (Lady Ga Ga's dancers were staying there at the same time for the VMA's).One block away from 59th street station, easy access to Penn and Grand Central where ever your business may take you."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 13 2009 ,OK...but there are better places out there,"Just arrived back this morning from a long weekend at The Hudson.I was well prepared for the size of the bedrooms, it was the bathroom that made me laugh! I am a petit young lady but I still only had 6cm ( I just HAD to measure it) from knee to wall when I was sitting on the loo! Bathrooms are WAY too small, anyone larger would have to climb over the toilet to get to the shower, I kid you not!Bathroom amenty kits were basic, not even a shower cap, let alone a bath robe.Air Con was a rattling old machine situated behind the bed, which we were lucky we did not use whilst in the room, far too noisy and I can imagine there were a lot of grumbles from the American guests who cant seem to live with ACThe rooms were very clean, a bit too basic, I do like a mini bar ( only so I can empty it and put all my Whole Food goodies in it), Tv was fine although easy to wack your head on. Other people have commented on the &quot;cabin&quot; like feel, it is a good way to describe it, however the bathroom on our boat is bigger than at The Hudson!We were on a the 6th floor facing south, if you are looking for peace and quiet this is not the hotel for you, it sounded like rockets were racing up and down 8th Ave most nights, did not bother me, I was sufficiently pickled not to care.Although the rooms were spotlessly clean, I did note the corridors were in need of a good vacuum,the edges of the dark grey carpets were VERY dusty. The corridors in general were looking tired, carpet starting to fray in areas, nasty scuffs to service doors and guest rooms doors. All well and good having dim lighting, but perhaps they need to turn it up when they are cleaning so they can see what they are doing.Staff were all friendly and helpful. Although the concierge desk was always busy busy busy and I am glad that I know New York well enough not to have needed to line up to ask a question.As was the front desk most of the time, I would recommend the Express check out in this case, most people have better things to do than line up on their last day in Manhattan!Bars were interesting and unique, we liked them all,expensive drinks but it is Manhattan, in a trendy hotel.We ate in The Hudson Caferteria the first night, nothing amazing...again too dark I could not even read my menu let alone see the food! The meal was not memorable put it that way!In a nut shell this hotel is for young, trendy crowd, I actually felt sorry seeing some of the older generation exit the lifts in the morning, wondering how they slept with the noise and managed to get in the bathroom with walking sticks and zimmer frames.There are better hotels in New York, glad I went but it would not be my first choice on my next visit if I was being honest"
Hudson Hotel,Oct 11 2009 ,Great location small rooms,"We stayed at this hotel for both business and leisure. We got a deal on Priceline, otherwise the regular room prices are expensive considering the rooms are very small. Though small rooms, they were nice and clean with design furniture. Also to restaurant area and the bar is very very nice.The service was good. Our initial impression was very negative because they did not have our room ready on time and made us wait 2 hours more for it, but they were apologetic and treated us to free drinks at the bar and free breakfast.The location is awesome, only one block from central park."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 10 2009 ,Very Uncomfortable Rooms !,"Don't waste your time if looking for comfort.What were they thinking with the Bathroom designDark and Tiny rooms, will never, ever go back!"
Hudson Hotel,Oct 9 2009 ,great,Superb hotel great staffGirls on help desk have patiance and knowledge of were to go and what to do
Hudson Hotel,Oct 9 2009 ,Pack light! Super teeny tiney room.,"I got &quot;upgraded&quot; to a better room than I paid for but it was still soooo small. The rooms barely have a closet, it's more like a cubby hole. The bathroom is even smaller! If you're tall, you'll hit your knees on the wall when sitting on the toilet. The hall ways are soo dark and dismal. The staff was nice enough and the rooms clean but it was just too uncomfortable staying there with my guy friend. Unless you pack light and have only 1 suitcase and don't plan to go shopping, this place is claustraphobic. I would happily stay here by myself though. It's nice enough and the locale is convinient but pretty much anywhere in NYC is convinient to me since I mostly like to go shopping."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 8 2009 ,4 out of 5,"Very small rooms and bathrooms. Very little light in rooms, hard to read.Skybar on 15th is a nice place to relax.Staff were all very nice.Try to get the buffet breakfast included in your package, it is very good and the room is coolNice gym with new equipmentHotel feels like a nightclub, so may not appeal to all travelers.Good location to most attractions"
Hudson Hotel,Oct 8 2009 ,Worth every penny. Great design hotel,"Great design hotel. Even though the Hudson has been a household name for a few years it is worth every penny. It is stylish, comfortable and mixes an electric atmosphere with friendly undertones. The bar is as famous as the hotel and still gets busy with a young crowd at weekends dont expect drinks to stop until the late hours it can be slightly noisy in rooms so if you like a peaceful nights sleep this isnt the hotel for you. Drinks are expensive but a great bar to start or end your night in. Rooms are modern and very small but clever design tries to disguise this. Great area to access the city and some great independant bars and cafes situated near the hotel. Would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes a lively stylish hotel close to all the major attractions. would definetely return."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 8 2009 ,Fantastic Location Fantastic Hotel. Who cares about Small Rooms!,"If you want to be in NYC without paying a small fortune for a room then the Hudson Hotel is perfect. Staff was very professional, friendly and happy. Loved the Skyview Terrace. Great Drinks, great food and absolutely fantastic view.The Hotel has an understated sophistication. If you are looking for a Hilton or Marriot experience this is not the Hotel for you. The location is fantastic. Close to Central Park. Close to Columbus Circle where all subways pass through.OK the rooms are small. But if you are coming to enjoy NYC you are really only going to sleep/shower in your room. If you are a business traveler and need to work in your room then not the place for you. If you want nightlife, sightseeing and a nice hotel then The Hudson is perfect."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 8 2009 ,Great hotel not for everyone,"The hotel is in a great location and is designed BEAUTIFULLY!!!! The lobby looks like something out of a fairy tale. The hotel has a very young, hip, trendy vibe about it. The rooms are VERY small, kind of like on a cruise ship. If you care about room size, this probably not the best choice for you, but if you are like me and spend hardly any time in the room, the hotel is great."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 8 2009 ,It was so so,"The hotel looks tired. There are no mini bars, even in the larger (and I use that term loosely) rooms. The lights are so low, and after further inspection, it seems to be because the hotel looks tired and not maintained well. The lobby level garden is great. The check in personnel was friendly. The beds were comfortable. TV was not a good picture. Bathroom amenities were sub par. The terrace on the 15th floor had terrible service and terrible food."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 7 2009 ,Awful. Cheesy. Not worth it. Oh and we found a cockroach.,"I've been dying to find time all week to write this review. Everyone needs to know just how awful our experience was at The Hudson Hotel.So my husband and I just wasted close to $700 on two nights at this super cheesy hotel. It's a wannabe &quot;see and be scene&quot; hotel, which obviously spent time, resources, and money on their lobby and three bars, because the hotel rooms are horrendous. When you walk down the dark, gray hallways you begin to feel like you're in an insane asylum. But let me take a step back. When we first arrived at the hotel, we stood in one of several lines for almost 40 minutes, waiting to check in. My husband and I noticed that almost every single person talking to someone behind the desk was complaining about something. We couldn't believe how long it was taking to simply check in.When we finally got to the desk, the person behind it didn't even apologize for our wait. He, like the rest of the staff, looked bored, unenthusiastic, and grim. What a way to welcome your guests! From the doormen (aspiring models, I assume?) and concierge, to the check-in staff, everyone just seemed clueless.Anyway, we got our room key and walked down the aforementioned hallways, which looked straight out of a horror film. I get it—you're trying to be minimalistic. Then we got to our room, which you couldn't really call a room—more like a broom closet. The bathroom is obscenely tiny, so anyone over 5&quot;4 should avoid this place at all costs.They put us on the 4th floor, where you couldn't avoid the horrendous traffic noise outside. I couldn't sleep the first night. To top things off, we found a dead COCKROACH in our bathroom. We asked to change rooms the next day and again, the woman behind the desk gave us no apologies when they &quot;upgraded&quot; us to another crappy room. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SERVICE!If you're a tourist who plans to party all weekend, this place is definitely for you. (But don't have the wine at the bar. Their selection is awful.) You'll also be sure to run into drunk people in the elevator. It's like being in Vegas!Overall, it was the one and only blemish to our trip to NYC."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 7 2009 ,Style great location...but could you get a smaller room?,"The Hudson enjoys a great location in the upper 50s, a short hop to Central Park and just across the road from a subway stop with great connections to mid and downtown areas. It's one of those modern, minimalist hotels that attempts to disguise its entrance, while inside the communual areas are all dark wood and subdued lighting (too much so at times - pretty silly when you can't read or see signs on doors). The Hudson is comfortable, it has a great, lively bar, a reasonably well-equipped basement gym, and the staff are warm, friendly and helpful. The big drawback to this property is the size of the standard rooms. I've stayed in numerous hotels here, but even by this city's standards these are tiny to a point where they are actually almost uncomfortable at times - you should be able to move around a hotel room, or sit on the can, without bumping into things. A good choice if you can get the right rate and maybe a deal - I got four nights for the price of three. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 7 2009 ,Think the Hudson is great rooms are small but location brilliant,"We checked in with some apprehension after reading the reviews. Our hotel had been booked via 'priceline'. However, we couldn't fault the Hudson. We were prepared for a small room and a small bathroom and whilst we could have lived with the room, the bed was too small for 2 girls on a 3 night trip. We upgraded for an extra 40$ per night and got a deluxe kingsize which was perfect - there was no issue with doing this. Hardly in the room anyway as so much to see! Location is close to subway and right by central park. Staff very helpful and friendly, rooftop bar lovely. Drinks expensive but probably the same in all NYC hotels. I think the Hudson gets unfair press. Real atmosphere on a saturday night!!! Would recommend to a friend."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 6 2009 ,Great stay!,"First off, the rooms are smaller than many other hotels in NY, however who realistically spends that much time in their room anyhow in NY. The lobby, bars, restaurant and and terrace are beautiful, and the staff extremely attentive and helpful of all needs. I would definitely recommend the hotel, as long as you can live with the small rooms."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 5 2009 ,European Hotel in Manhattan,"When I read the reviews before our trip I was a little nervous about the Hudson, but on arrival I was very happy. The hotel is very modern, the bars and restaurants interesting and fun and the rooms, although small for American hotels were quite charming. The staff was friendly and helpful and the location is fabulous. Less than one block from the subway station and you can walk everywhere. The negative reviews must have come from travelers that have never been to Europe and experienced really small rooms. We can't wait to go back."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 4 2009 ,dont bother,"if you like to vacation in a tuna can then this is the place for you.The rooms are so incredibly small. I am from New york an have stayed in many NYC hotels....this guest room was half the size of the others. The service is very good and the bars/lounges are beautiful, but i would definitely stay elsewhere.People say its NY and you have to expect small rooms. That is not true. there are plenty that have nice size rooms."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 4 2009 ,Great place to stay,"My husband and I took a short trip to New York and were very happy with this hotel. The entire staff was extremely helpful and friendly from beginning to end. We loved the decor and the different bars where you could relax for a drink. The rooms are extremely small, but if you aren't going to spend much of your day there, who cares? The bathroom was interesting, with the toilet being so close to the wall. Heavy or tall people would have a difficult time - and more than one person couldn't be in there at once. Also the shower is see-through, which is something to consider. The location of the hotel is great, really close to the park, Columbus Circle, and the theater district. We would definitely recommend staying at the Hudson!"
Hudson Hotel,Oct 1 2009 ,outstanding client focus from entire staff,"from check in to check out, the hotel staff was friendly, helpful and fun. i enjoyed the location and the amenities of the hotel. i would highly recommend to others and will stay again during my next visit to nyc. thank you."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 29 2009 ,A memorable experience we would happily relive,"We arrived at the Hudson with some trepidation having read some of the negative reviews here, but from the moment we walked in to the lobby, any concerns were instantly dispelled. The staff was friendly and courteous; the room (while small, yes, but we didn't come to New York to hang out in a hotel room) was quiet, clean and well appointed; and the entire atmosphere and design of the place was impressive.We look forward to staying at the Hudson again and will certainly recommend it to friends."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 29 2009 ,Terrific hotel great location helpful staff,"We just got back from a weekend in Manhattan staying at the Hudson and we are so glad we stayed at this great hotel! We loved the film noir atmosphere and the many different venues for lounging--the rooftop bar, the garden bar, the library, the nightclub. Our room was tiny yes, but had a minimalist chic to it. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, even loaning us an umbrella on a rainy Sunday. Don't miss Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery in the Time Warner building down the block!"
Hudson Hotel,Sep 25 2009 ,Tiny badly lit rooms,"If you dont mind staying in Tiny rooms which are badly lit and cost a fortune, you are in for a treat.great bar and funky public areas (which you can enjoy without being a guest)"
Hudson Hotel,Sep 24 2009 ,Always my favorite!,"My husband and I stayed at the Hudson in August for my second time, his first. We love the Hudson Hotel, it's beautiful, affordable, comfortable, and the staff is always very competent and friendly. We enjoyed wine and dessert in the amazing cafeteria one evening, and had drinks outside on the terrace another. In NYC, the Hudson is a great place to end your day and come &quot;home&quot; to."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 24 2009 ,Great Location and Price but at what cost?,"This is a great hotel if you don't care about room size and you just want a clean hotel for a cheap price around central park. Definately not for people over 50. Room was tiny, but clean and comfortable. 2 people can't use the bathroom at the same time, but there is a glass window that will let you watch the other one take a shower while you sit in bed (if you are into that) The roof top patio is great, the lobby nightclub blows! It isTouristy, and has horrible service. Not a real NYC nighclub. All in all I was happy with my stay, but this hotel is not worth more than $150 a night and don't expect to get treated like an individual here."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 23 2009 ,Tiny yes.. Would go back? Yes,"I stayed 9 nights, and people, yes .. Rooms are very small. you get basic, bed, TV, desk, chair, and luggage rack... You use every available horizontal space to put stuff, yes .. BUT THIS IS NY and you will be out all day long! .. This is a great spot to come back after walking, shopping, dining, etc etc etc have a shower and continue, or call it a day and have a good night sleep and be ready for next day. Location is fantastic, 300 yards to the subway and a block and a half from the park is priceless. The bar is bouncing all night, everyday.. but to be honest I was on the 12th floor, and didnt hear a thing at night, so erase that part of previous reviews. The terrace is great and staff is always helpful. If you have ever stayed at a hip hotel u know the lighting is not bright in corridors, so erase that part as well.. My only comment is that I would add some lighting IN THE ROOMS only.. So in average, I had a great stay, would go back, and if you want to use the hotel as your NY base, go ahead..."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 19 2009 ,SLEEP SOUNDLY COFFIN SYLE,"If you don';t mind sleepoing in a coffin, without a name, feel free to stay here. Location is perfect, excellent staff, sky terrace even better but the rooms are without a doubt, the most dimunutive, smallest, minuscule rooms I have ever experienced. Don't look for a sign advertising the hotel because you won;t find one and don't even think you can guess the color of the walls or carpeting in the hallways due to the very limited lighting.They call the decore Chic, but I call it CHEAP! Check it out for yourself. I challenge you to guess the decorating cost in this 30 square foot crackerbox. I bet it didn't amount to more that $400.00 per room including the cost of bed, desk, sad looking lamps with lips and window treatments. PATHETIC! For more excitment, you can observe your friend or loved one peeing or bathing from the large window illuminating into the bathroom from the bedromm area. Due to limited space, you can't help but see this if you are in the room at the same time because there is no where else to go other than sit at the desk directly in front of the window or lie on the bed because there is no room to stand on either side of the bed. THE BATHROOM IS ANOTHER STORY. IF YOU ARE MORE THAN 5'5&quot;, BE PREPARED TO CLASH YOUR KNEES AGAINST THE WALL IF YOU SIT ON THE TOILET. I WILL NEVER, AND I MEAN NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN. NEITHER WILL MY FRIENDS."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 18 2009 ,fabulous-loved it,"i like many others was wary after reading a few bad reviews but was very pleasantly surprised. i stayed for 5 nites with my boyfriend and we loved it. the decor is very cool and though the rooms are smallish they are very modern and space is used well! the staff were so friendly and helpful. the bars inside and out are worth a look. and the rooftop terrace has a lovely relaxed open feel with sun loungers and a hammock! only ate once in the outdoor bar, though it was a little pricey. overall a very good experience and would definetly recommend to any young couple or maybe a group of friends. ( you would need to upgrade if more than 2!) .enjoyed the experience and was reluctant to leave! the comfortable pillows added to my good feelings bout this place!!"
Hudson Hotel,Sep 18 2009 ,Don't Bother,My meeting was a disaster. Internet repeatedly failed. Cell phones don't work well in meeting rooms. Temperature of room was either too hot or too cold. Management was unaccountable. The food made us queasy... The place has become dirtier since my last visit.
Hudson Hotel,Sep 16 2009 ,Some pros but too many cons,"I was looking forward to staying in this hotel, having been to the bars before on previous visits to New York.Overall, I have found the experience pretty disappointing. First of all, here are the pros:- Great location- Lots of places to eat nearby and also some decent bars not too far away- Nice bars within the hotel, although the clientele were a little sad- My room (the studio type) was actually quite a decent sized room.Cons- Service is not good in this hotel, especially at the front desk, which I found sloppy and pretty unprofessional. There was no polish to the service. The staff didn't really seem like they cared about the hotel guest's experience.- Bar prices are far too high - $9 for a bottle of beer...- Bathrooms are not very good at all although there are decent showers. They're a bit cheap looking.- Rooms have a safe but it's not bolted down, therefore a waste of time- No fridges in rooms- $7.50 for a bottle of water in your room, if you can't be bothered going out to buy it- Sound insulation is rubbish. I did not get a single night's undisturbed sleep. I was woken up by the noise of other guests opening and closing their doors.Overall I would say some people would like this hotel - if they hadn't stayed in a good hotel before. It's very much a 3* hotel in my book and I wouldn't recommend it to friends. NY has loads of hotels, many in great locations and this hotel lacks features to make it stand out from the crowd. The most annoying thing of all during my stay was when I tried to have a drink in the 'library bar' and when I sat down, I was told half the bar was 'reserved for a private party'. I'm not really interested in staying hotels where the guest is second fiddle to the public."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 16 2009 ,It s past it and I am past it .... too expensive for what it is / should be / was,"Never again, never, ever! The spin goes that the Hudson “was” a dormitory redesigned by Philippe Stark into a haven of high design for the hip and well heeled – “the next generation of Cheap Chic – stylish, democratic, young at heart and utterly cool”.. I’d say that the Hudson IS a dormitory/flop house where form definitely trumps substance. The problem with all these sharp, pristine design places is… what do you do when they are no longer neither sharp nor pristine? They start fraying at the edges and slip in clientele. I can get the Hudson as a fun hang out for 20 something’s from the world over arriving in town and NYC being their oyster, I get the Cheap Chic, young at heart and cool references … but if it is the young uber cool tribe that they wish to attract then these walk in wardrobes of rooms should be at a lower price. USD 495 for a tiny room with no mini-bar and minimal service is neither Cheap nor Chic to me.… I get the feeling that the Hudson is more filled more by Priceline than Facebook or the hip and well heeled. And this is why a generationally specific environment gets filled by other generations who will feel like fish out of water. People like me! …. people who do not want to deal with a blaring empty disco vibe in the lobby and every night and elevators all day and who may react weirdly to “Hey dude” from bar staff.Apparently I was lucky, the nice Korean lady assigned to cleaning my room let me know that I had “one of the biggest rooms in the hotel” ..; I was neither feeling my luck nor the love of the Hudson. My room was very small and dark. No bath only a shower with a curtain that did a very bad job of containing the water – brought a whole new spin on the “wet bathroom” concept. It took the longest I have ever experienced for the water to heat up once I ran the shower. Very annoying sheer net curtains served as the doors to the closet and to hide acces to the bathroom as well as a thematic anchor for the décor. The got stuck constantly! Wifi worked well though the hotel web site was somewhat misleading in giving the impression it was free for my room category. Room service was sporadic with something forgotten or mistaken on each of the two times I used it for breakfast in four. On two occasions I had very important messages from business contacts not reach me from the concierge desk to the clear detriment of the organisation of my trip.Yet .. I feel like a grouch .. I am in my forties and past it probably! (yet I shared this view with many I spoke with over the music in the elevators) ….I know many younger people in the creative or high tech fields who would have a blast here .. but not at the prices the Hudson demands. They need to rebuild the demographic of their clientele here and get with the hip rather than foisting the Hip on an unsuspecting past it clientele… like me."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 15 2009 ,Terrible experience,"Well I'm actually stuck at this hotel for three more days on a business trip. I got to my room last night exhausted after a very long day and was shocked by how small and dark it was. I had to crawl around on the floor looking for an electrical outlet which I found behind my bed - when I stood up I hit my face on the TV screen which is placed on the wall next to the bed leaving no room to maneuver. Blood was pouring out of the cut between my eyes and I was pretty hysterical. I called the front desk and asked to speak to the manager so I could get advice on what to do (certainly NOT wanting to spend my night at a NYC ER) - I was 3 times connected to a line that just rang and rang with no answer. I called front desk again asking where the manager was and was told that 'security' would be coming to my room - I asked emphatically not to send security. 5 minutes later two big body guard types were knocking on my door . . .and still no word from the management. By the time, the manager finally called me I was furious - he offered no assistance other than offering to 'see if their house doctor was available, which would be a $300 charge to my room' and insisted I had to fill out a report with 'security' . . .and then sent the security guards to my room again! I went with my bloody face to find ice - only to find the machine on my floor and the next floor not working - on the third floor I finally found some. Luckily I was able to get ahold of friend's who live in the city who recommended a plastic surgeon to give me stiches this morning. Oh and I asked for a wake up call this morning . . .and didn't get it!"
Hudson Hotel,Sep 13 2009 ,The bed gave me a back ache,"The location is good.There is nothing on the front of the hotel to identify it--no name, no address--which I find pretentious and annoying. You only know you're in the right place if you know about the chartreuse-lighted escalator. The public areas of this hotel are lovely--the lobby with the skylit, ivy-covered roof, the two outdoor bars (one on the 15th floor with a view), the cozy library bar, the lively dance bar, and the attractive though expensive &quot;cafeteria.&quot; The rooms are tiny but stylish. The size would have been OK for myself, traveling alone. But I had three complaints: 1. The air conditioning was noisy. Every time it cranked up it was like there was a buzz saw in the room. 2. The bathroom was so tiny that I could barely squeeze onto the toilet (and I'm 5' 2&quot;!). Also, the stylish sink fixtures dripped unless you got the lever in just the right spot. 3. Most of all, the bed gave me a back ache that still hurt for a couple of days after I got home and slept on my good mattress. If the above complaints could be addressed (possibly in a different room) I might consider staying there again."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 12 2009 ,New York First Timer,Located close to central park with easy tube access to the rest of the city this place was ideal for a first time tourist. The rooms are small but with everything you need. Didn't eat in the restaurant but enjoyed the bar in the garden.. Enjoyed the stay - got some great tips off the concierge for going out. Probably wouldn't return to the same hotel in any city as large as New York but would definitely reccommend to friends.
Hudson Hotel,Sep 12 2009 ,new york chic at its best,"loved it, loved it! on arrival a member of staff was there to take our suitcases which was a relief after dragging them around all day. we checked in the receptionist was extremeley friendly, on arrival we decided to upgrade to the bigger room with 2 doubles after hearing the rooms were tiny. we paid an extra $50 a night. once we were in the room defo worth it room was a fab size massives of space. not lots of clothes space but we could manage. decor v. cool and just look clean and the beds so inviting after a trans atlantic flight. my fav part the roof top terrace so beautiful and relaxing after a hard days sightseeing! drinks expensive but i think worth it $14 white wine. all the staff i spoke to were really friendly and helpful.good location one block from central park. 10 mins ish to time square. little cafe on the corner open all the time or snacks. new york is the best place in the world ( in my opinion) would defo recomend the hudson and would stay there again!the bad reviews are maybe valid in terms the double rooms being small but u do have the option to upgrade if u feel that strongly about havin a bigger room. the hostel comments are certainly a little much. the clientel is definately of a young hip visitors, if you wants something more traditional then book the waldof or the roosevelt etc. but come on your in nyc who cares that much!!!!"
Hudson Hotel,Sep 9 2009 ,an easy hit,"We stayed at the Hudson after doing tonnes of research and trawling through the best deals at the time. We finally decided after their &quot;stay 3 nights get 1 free&quot; offer (and I had watched too much Sex and the City - the one where Smith waited for Samantha at the bottom of the lifts after she cheated on him with Richard was filmed here!) and overall enjoyed our stay. It's in a good location, close to Central Park and the subway, and the hotel is very clean. In response to all the &quot;too trendy&quot; comments - a New Yorker summed up the hotel nicely saying &quot;it was the place to be...10 years go&quot;. It used to be uber-trendy but has lost its edge, which to be honest I was quite happy with. They closed the bar to residents a couple of evenings that we were there, and really tried to put you off going in with dress codes, clubbing music early evening, etc. The roof terrace though is really, really nice and much more relaxed.Yes, the rooms are seriously small even by London standards but they are the same across the city. If you're on holiday in NYC you aren't going to spend much time in your room, does it really matter? It's an easy hit when you have an infinite number of places to choose from."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 7 2009 ,Brilliant Stay,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Hudson for 5 nights to celebrate our 21st Birthdays. I was a bit worried after seeing some of the reveiws but I must say I had a great time. The staff could not have been more helpful, including the man outside the front of the hotel who suggested a couple of bars for us to visit. I will admit the room is a little small but who care you are not in New York to stay in the room. It provided everything you needed. The bed was comfy, it was clean (the maids where brilliant) and there was suffient space for your shopping. We were on level 14 and so didn't hear any of the noise from the bars. The aircon was a little bit noisy but it was really good in the hot weather so we didnt mind. Also by the time we got back to the hotel we fell straight to sleep anyway. There were a number of small touches. The safe was free, there was an ipod dock and on the last day when it rained we were able to borrow an umbrella from the front desk. These may seem like silly things but they made our stay more comfortable. It is in a great location just a few minutes walk from the tube and central park. There was also a great mexican on 9th avenue not far from the hotel. We also went to a bakery in the shopping centre on columbus circle which was brilliant and just what we needed to start the day. Along with the bakery there was a restaurant next to it where we had a fantastic breakfast which I would recommend. This hotel may not be everyones cup of tea, especially if you are tall, however, for us it was perfect and made our holiday that much better."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 6 2009 ,Great time but small room,"I liked the atmosphere, I enjoyed the way the rooms are decorated, but I think they definitely are too small."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 6 2009 ,Great location cool atmosphere,"First of all, I would like to thank all the reviewers. I knew exactly what to expect when I arrived. Yes, the room is small, so what? My room at home is certainly bigger but when I travel I dont expect a suite, unless I pay for it. I definitely prefer a small room in a modern, clean hotel than a bigger room in an old fashioned, old looking hotel. To be honest, the room felt cosy after all. We didnt have any problem storing our shopping bags, and we did a lot of shopping. There is a small wardrobe were you can place your luggage, and a few hangers for your clothes, and you can place all your shopping on an upper shelf. It is a matter of being a bit organised. The bathroom is small but again, I dont need anything else apart from it being clean. It even fits a bathtub. Good TV and stereo (which we didnt use). After reading many reviews I can say that you cannot blame he hotel for other guests banging doors etc. While in the room you cannot hear your fellow guests next door. Downsides: windows should be double glazed to avoid the noise coming from the street, even on the 19th floor you can hear the traffic. We were given room 543 upon arrival, and we had to change the next morning since right outside were lots of huge AC machines which made lots of noise. The hotel should not sell that room, you cannot sleep there. It feels like you are on a plane with that constant buzzing. But again, newxt morning we were given a room on he 19th floor and no problem. It is true that the AC in the room is very noisy. Other stuff: the common areas are spectacular, the library room is fantastic, and so is the roof terrace. Yes, drinks are not cheap, but you are in NYC, in a great roof terrace on the 15th floor, how much are you willing to pay? I have paid more money for a drink in a lot less fancier bars, so I recommend it, at least once you have to experience it at night. By the way, I never heard any noises coming from the club in the room. Staff were helpful when we needed any assistance, no delay in either check in or out. And the location is just great, you can walk to Times Sq in 10-15 min, and you are right at the entrance of Central Park. Walking distance to most sites. And also Columbus Circle subway station will take you to many other places without having to chang trains, although beware since the subway is a bit tricky and you have to use different entrances to different lines. Around the hotel you have many places to have bfast, so I wouldnt pay 25$ at the hotel. I so recommend the Hudson, but of course deppending on the rate you are paying. I think 125$ a night is more than fair for what we got. I hope to be back one day!!"
Hudson Hotel,Sep 5 2009 ,Still like but as much as before,"I have stayed at the Hudson many times and always love it but I am not loving some new changes they have made. #1 No mini bar in roomThis is huge mistake if you ask me. It felt like 100 degrees when I was there I I had to walk down the hall forever to get water! Also, if you get in late there is NO FOOD anywhere. Tired from a long flight, I still had to walk to a corner lousy deli to buy SOMETHING AWFUL to eat because I was so hungry. Upon returning to hotel they would not let me eat it on their table in the bar even though NO ONE was in the bar. My only other complaint is that things are too pricey. The food area when it is open is way too expensive. A morning latte is $9! And why don't they offer free wi-fi like everyone else does now? Nope..$10 to access the internet. Drinks on the terrace? Expect to pay about $15 a drink....ouch.So, other than my food issues and pricing I still like The Hudson for it's style and location. I like that a lot of Europeans stay there. And lastly, the staff is super super nice---all of them."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 31 2009 ,Disgusting and gross,"Horrible experience with poor front desk management skills. Our first room had over 1 foot of water in the tub after we tried to shower. Took a while for it to be fixed, and we were offered to switch rooms for our troubles. It took hours for them to switch our room, and the new room had a broken AC. Could not sleep all night. We canceled our third night, and went back home with a bitter taste. Also the dingy dark hallways, concealed the stained carpets. I would never stay here again! It was miserable!"
Hudson Hotel,Aug 18 2009 ,Asked for a non-smoking room got a smoking room.,"Just checked in. It didn't seem so bad at first, and I was too tired to go down and re-ask for what I asked for in the first place. Now my eyes are watering. Can't open the window. Totally toxic. The bars and roof lounge look beautful, but I won't be back."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 17 2009 ,Trendy Hotel with SMALL Rooms,"Arriving at the Hudson on Saturday night I was prepared for a small hotel room, I had warned my husband multiple times that we were staying in one of the smallest hotel rooms on the planet. I had not envisioned this small. Picture a room with a queen sized bed and one foot of space on each side of the bed - I felt like I was in a walk-in closet. Luckily we did not spend alot of time there, as one person has to be sitting on the bed for the other to be able to move about the room. If you are taller than 6 feet you also will likely not be able to sit on the toilet as your knees will hit the wall in front of you. So aside from the small room here are my thoughts:Pros:- Very cool atmosphere, if you go be sure to check out the rooftop patio &amp; courtyard bars- Impressive lobby- Decent price ($175 per night plus a $50 per day room credit to use in the hotel because of the package we selected)- Modern &amp; trendy decor- Friendly concierge &amp; front desk staff- We did not see this until it was too late but appreantly there is a really hip nightclub in the hotel on certain evenings (would have been good to mention upon our arrival)- Across the street from subway system, lots of stores and food options nearby, close to Central Park &amp; within walking distance to Times SquareCons:- Price of food &amp; drink (two mixed drinks cost $40 with tip and breakfast for two people was $50 daily)- It is extermely dark throughout the hotel including the rooms- Room was a bit noisy, we could hear doors slamming throughout the night &amp; morning- Room floors looked like they had not been cleaned in months- Service slow at bars &amp; restaurantsOverall our stay was fair, we luckily did not spend much time in our hotel room, it was cramped for two people especially after a few shopping bags were added to the room. If you can afford a larger room I would consider that option. If we had not had the $50 room credit I would not have eaten at the restaurant for breakfast every day, the food was good but not worth $25 per plate."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 16 2009 ,Hip Dormitory,"If this hotel used to be a college dormitory, it shows in the rooms.Compared to all the cookie cutter business hotels I've stayed in, this was a very memorable stay. Sure the hotel had its faults but I stayed here for the chance to try something different and the hotel met my wish.The lobby is eye opening, from the escalator ride up from street level to the checkin desk under a canopy of vines, the atmosphere was chic. Although I didn't go into club, the fact that it was still hopping at 1AM was exciting.Rooms are dormitory small and the wood paneling just provides false cover. The showers were barely wider than a telephone booth. Cheap air conditioning and small television sets.If the price is lower than $150 (or if the sheer boredom of staying in corporate hotels is too overwhelming) then stay here. If not, then there are plenty of other options in the city."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 15 2009 ,A little sad...,"If the Hudson were a showgirl, her name would be Lola (as in Lola from Copa Cabana - &quot;but that was 30 years ago when she used to have her show...&quot;) Don't get me wrong. The rooms are smallish but nice. The amenities are great - but the vibe of the entire place had the feeling of 2:00 am desperation. You arrive at street level through non-descript doors and you follow the radioactive lights up an escalator. When I arrived, the computers were down, so I had to wait close to 30 minutes to be checked in manually. The bar across the lobby was playing loud disco - so I asked to be placed away from all that, and I was. The restaurant behind the counter looked interesting but I did not try it as there seemed to be big bouncers everywhere. Maybe Barry was in town... Good location near TimeWarner Center and Columbus Circle. Great nearby restaurants as well - but I don't think I'll stay here again. I did dance to Copa Cabana when it first came out, but I'd like to think I've grown up since then."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 15 2009 ,Trendy is just a cover-up,"Me and a good friend of mine are making a roundtrip troughout the U.S.A. and already stayed in a lot of different hotels. Due to the fact that we are students we booked our rooms using priceline.com. We slept for example in the franchises: Mariott, Radisson and Delta. A few weeks before sleeping at the hotels we made phonecalls to ask for double bedrooms, there was no problem at all until we called the Hudson hotel. A kind of unfriendly lady told us it would be impossible to sleep in a double bedroom even when we offered to pay for an upgrade. When arrived at the hotel we kindly asked again for an upgrade to a double bedroom, unfortunately all the rooms were occupied but the lady offered us an alternative (kind of strange since it was impossible to upgrade by phone). We could upgrade for $40 a night to a deluxe room which was equipped with a queen bed (which should be larger than the regular one). This was the only option to sleep seperately because this room was spacy enough to equip with a roll-in bed that she could arrange. Unfortunately the bed wasn't arrived after 3 hours and we had to ask it again for 3 times before the bed was rolled in.Well, we don't understand how you can equip a room with such a tiny queen bed. I'm 6 foot 5 and I don't even fit in the bed, my best guess is that the bed is about 6 foot 3. So if you are taller than 6 foot it would already be too small. The roll-in bed is a joke.This hotel acts like it is really fashioned and trendy, but we felt that as a cover-up for inferior quality."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 14 2009 ,A treat for those who appreciate style and service!,"I had a number of stays over 8 months at the Hudson Hotel. The staff and facilities were outstanding! You have it all in this cool boutique hotel! A great restaurant, beautiful outdoor (weather permitting) and indoor spaces with comfort that says stay a while! Evenings the night club gets pumping for the trendy, beautiful people who just want to have a great time....What the rooms lack in space (a single is pretty small) they make up for with a cool, breezy, well grounded design. When traveling, less time in the room is my motto and when it's time to sleep I want the bed to feel like a retreat; home away from home.... I love the white duvets and great pillows! Design wise the warm, rich texture of the wood paneled walls in contrast with the crisp white linens that soften the space, flow breezily making the room feel very high end, and like they knew you were worth it."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 13 2009 ,Not 3-star. Great location but rooms WAY TOO SMALL even for NYC.,"Good: This hotel is chic. Great common areas, hip bar and courtyard, and very modern. The location is great, right off Central Park South and behind the Times Warner Center at Columbus Circle.Bad: The rooms are the smallest I've ever seen. I thought I was on a hidden camera show when I walked into the room. These rooms are even &quot;small&quot; on a NYC scale. The rate was $279/night for a &quot;deluxe queen' room. I would have loved to have seen the smaller rooms..................can't imagine a smaller room. This &quot;deluxe queen&quot; was about 180 sq. ft. ..................that's small!!!Plus the room had dark wood paneling on EVERY inch of the walls. I think this was supposed to make it look luxurious, but it made the room dreary and depressing and even made it feel smaller than it really was. Well, I think what made it feel small was the fact that the WALLS WERE SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER, hahahaha.The bed barely fit in the room. Looked like it was wedged between 2 custom night stands (which were custom because you can't normally buy night stands this small) and the night stands were touching the side walls.This is just greed at it's finest. If, when rennovating this hotel, they would have knocked the walls down between the rooms, doubling the size of the rooms, then it would have been suffice. Still it would have been 360 sq ft, but comparable to most NYC hotel rooms at that point."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 12 2009 ,Birthday Weekend,"Expected to get a tiny room, actually we booked a superior queen, worth every penny, got a great deal at booking.com, the Hudson is chic, stylish, hip &amp; trendy, We stayed 4 nights, the location can't be beat, had the most amazing and romantic time, thanks for everything, will be back, cheers, Lee &amp; Amanda......."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 12 2009 ,Small noisy air con very strange service,I had never been offered 1 tiny hole of a room with see-through bathroom facility and very loud air con for 2 girlfriends (not a couple) before!!! What were they thinking? No need to say we didn't actually stay.
Hudson Hotel,Aug 11 2009 ,Over priced small rooms disaster of a stay.,"This is one of the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. My family and I traveled with three children up the East Coast and visited eight states over two and a half weeks. We stated at 6 different hotels, all rated three-star or higher. The Hudson was, by far, the worst hotel we stayed in. Knowing that this is New York, we expected small rooms and the prices high. But the Hudson's rooms are tiny even by NYC standards - even with a $40/night deluxe &quot;upgrade.&quot; The Hudson is also difficult to find, the staff was generally unhelpful, and the elevators play loud rock music. The Hudson bills itself as &quot;urban chic,&quot; but the rooms are better described as just &quot;plain cheap.&quot;"
Hudson Hotel,Aug 11 2009 ,hip and trendy in the City,"I just got back from a long weekend in NYC with a group of three girlfriends. We stayed at this hotel and had a great time.The public spaces are very cool and hip. Yes, they are dark but that is the vibe they were going for. There are two great outdoor spaces for food and drink if you would like a bit of sunlight.We stayed in 2 standard queen rooms. I booked standard doubles, but were upgraded to standard queen when we checked into the hotel. The woman at the front desk was very nice and just offered the rooms without being asked. In fact, all of the staff that we came across were extremely nice.I am not sure how big the people are that complained about not being able to fit into the bathroom comfortably, but one of my girlfriends is 6 foot tall and she had no issues.The only bit of advice I might give would be to get a room on an upper floor. The club/bar in the lobby is very loud. We stayed on the 12th floor and couldn't hear it but I bet you could on about the 10th.I would definitely stay here again. It was a great location for a great price - we paid $100 a night per room."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 11 2009 ,Good location but a tight fit,"The Hotel porters who sussed from our luggage tags that we had arrived in NY on the Queen Mary 2 bet us before we saw our room that it would be smaller than our cabin on the ship. Too true. The management might describe the accommodation as being bijoux, trendy or arty but does this apply to having only 8 inches of clearance between the front edge of the en-suite wc and the blank dividing wall? The Hudson was constructed in 1928 by the daughter of J.P Morgan as a clubhouse for the American Women’s Association and a residence for young women. Consequently the rooms are small and not designed for multiple occupancy. One assumes the ladies had single beds, better suited to the room dimensions.We only got $1.43 to the pound so the cost of Hudson Hotel food, drink and particularly room-service was prohibitive. We dined out and breakfasted at a local coffee house.The Hotel atrium is attractive and the roof terrace [ when open ] is an asset. But the main attraction of the Hotel is its location. It is close to the Subway at the SW corner of Central Park and there are several ethnic restaurants in the vicinity. Times Sq area is within walking distance [just]When checking out of the Hudson please avoid the large queues at the desk that can form at peak period when numerous guests are arriving and departing. Pre-arrange your checkout or you may miss your transfers to the Airport."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 10 2009 ,Go for a drink instead,"Myself and my husband avoided staying in the hotel due to the tiny rooms, however we went for drinks one evening instead. On arrival the places bright yellows lights and décor make it very enticing. We headed to the Secret Garden terrace bar, located on the 15th Floor to have a few cocktails – some of which were the best we drunk during our stay. The waitresses in the courtyard and rooftop bar were scantly dressed in Moroccan style clothes. A little bit seedy, however all staff were very friendly. Many of the rooms appear to overlook the courtyard, which was playing very loud funky tunes – perhaps not ideal for the guests in their rooms. We enjoyed the ambiance of the sky terrace however we were immensely glad we had not stayed there as the windows were the size of matchboxes and so closely packed together, the rooms must have been tiny. Go for a drink, but avoid the place if you want a bit of space."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 9 2009 ,Even an elf would have a hard time fitting into the standard room,"I recently spent the night here. For $235 per night, I was shocked when I opened the door to what looked like a broom closet. I had booked a standard non smoking queen room. When we arrived, we were told they just had smoking rooms available. The rooms smelled like a box of marlboro cigarettes. The hallway leading up to the door was dark and dingy, run down. I've stayed in cruise ship cabins that were larger. There was 1 foot of space on either side of the lumpy bed which has since caused me 3 trips to the chiropractor. The only amenities provided in the room were two cracked rinsing cups. I have never in my life seen a room this tiny. The bathroom tile and room decor was very no frills. You had to stretch your neck like a giraffe to see the tv on the wall. Sitting on the toilet seat was impossible because of the wall right in front of you. The only nice thing about the hotel were the common areas, it seems like the hotel spent all their money on the lobby/restaurants and built a motel 6 above. Very disappointed!!!!!"
Hudson Hotel,Aug 9 2009 ,Only for lone travellers intending to spend minimal time in hotel,"My husband and I stayed 3 nights in this hotel in August. Overall, I was satisfied, but my husband not. Here are a few points:- Great location: 1 minute walk from Columbus Circle metro station, serving a few metro train lines, including Line A which will take you directly to JFK airport. Also, it is very close to Central Park, and about 20 minutes walk to Broadway theatre district. It is close to restaurants and cafes, and a shopping mall (where you can find the Whole Foods grocery shop). - Peculiar decor. The lobby and the rooms are decorated stylishly, that is, if you like this kind of modern decoration. The main complaint we had was that it was too dark everywhere: in the lobby, in the restaurants, and in the rooms. - Hardwood floor and nice wood paneling in our room, which I really liked.- Room is very small -- many other reviewers have already commented on this. - Bathroom is very small -- I don't particularly mind a small bathroom without a tub (shower only), but there does not seem to be enough room in front of the toilet, making it very cramped. (I am a small person, so I could still fit into the space, but I imagine it would be really difficult for a big or even an average person.) Also, not enough room around the sink to place the basic things (like cups and toothpaste). - No free Internet. One has to pay US$10 per day for wireless Internet access. No wired Internet.- The restaurant in the hotel is expensive, and the food is not good. Avoid the crab cakes. They are so salty I had to drink a lot of water to wash them down! (As I was hungry, otherwise I would not have touched them). I would say try restaurant outside the hotel. It is very close to the Hell's Kitchen district with lots of restaurants to fit every taste.- The AC in the room is very noisy, so we had to turn it off to go to sleep. - Lots of noise from the busy streets below (we were on the sixth floor). - Our room was very far away from the elevator. I never thought this could be a problem until we actually walked for probably 2 minutes (3 long corridors and two turns) to get from the elevator to our room. If you have lots of luggage or small children, this could be a problem. In short, if you are a lone traveler intending to spend minimal time in the hotel, this could be ideal. Otherwise, you need to consider the pros and cons."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 7 2009 ,Fantastic - Funky ,"If you want a few days away in New York, then stay here! We stayed here about 2 months ago as my wife to be was getting her wedding dress in New York.The rooms are fairly small but large enough for a very comfortable stay. There is no need for larger rooms, you are in New York!!The hotel is very clean and the staff are friendly and courteous. The light bar is cool and the bartenders could not be friendlier!We actually extended our honeymoon plans to go back to the Hudson for 2 nights at the start of September!! We were only suppost to be in transit in JFK.Cant Wait !!"
Hudson Hotel,Aug 5 2009 ,Cool Oasis in the concrete jungle,"The chic Hudson Hotel is a great destination. Most enjoyable are a variety of common areas that suite different styles. Indoor/Outdoor dining, the club, the Secret Garden which has partial cover in case of rain, and the Sky Terrace. Previous posters have mentioned the &quot;creepy dim lit hallways&quot;. There was no problem seeing where you were going, and I enjoyed the change from the usual harsh institutional lighting. The hallways are painted a dark grey, so the illusion of darkness is probably magnified by this. Hotel staff were pleasant and attentive. Rooms were clean, well appointed, and comfortable.The negatives have to do with the check in process. Official check in time is 3pm. We checked in at noon, and were told the room wasn't ready, however it would be within the hour. We decided to relax on the Secret Garden terrace while we waited. We made 3 separate inquiries during the next 4 hours about our room, being told each time that it wasn't ready yet. It was almost 5pm before we were given access to our room. The wait was made more annoying by the fact that we couldn't use the room charge, even though we were checked in, until we physically had our things in the room. Due to circumstances, my daughter and I were at the hotel without my wallet so being denied use of our room charge kept us from even enjoying a drink during the time. We also noted other tourists being offered free drinks, but were told this is something only management could authorize. By my own admission, I am not pushy and err on the side of being too friendly so I did not press the issue.Overall, I enjoyed the hotel. The feel of the hotel and the neighborhood are both big positives."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 3 2009,Location is great,"After reading the reviews on this site...I was certainly skeptical...First the good- location is perfect. Loved the shopping right across the street, great lunches at Bouchon. Subway station at Colombus Circle couldn't be more convenient. Staff was very friendly, staff at front door was first rate- helping with subway and walking directions. Outdoor patio both on main floor and 15th floor were lovely. Ok, now the negative...hotel has no sign outside- friends meeting us could not find it...too cool for a sign?? Room was like my grandmothers basement with dark paneled walls and no light. Bed was uncomfortable. I will not reiterate the room size issue- suffice to say it is extremely small. We overlooked the main floor patio and that evening there was a concert and it was loud in the room- glad to leave for dinner! The hallways were dark and dare I say- spooky!!! Would make a good location for a slasher movie!! Overall, since I got the room for a steal on priceline, I can't complain due to the perfect location. Would not be my first choice to stay there again tho."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 2 2009 ,Location vs Legroom - the tall man's burden,"My wife and I had a week at the Hudson last year. As with every reviewer who didn't pay up for a big room or get a jammie upgrade, we were prepared for small. Perhaps not, though, for surreal small. Not Borrowers small. Not Fraggle Rock small. My wife has pictures of me (fully clad and for descriptive purposes only) stretched out across the bed. Although quite tall, cross ways the room extended from my head to my shins; lengthways, from headboard my feet very nearly reached the shower. Weird feeling, sleeping in there with its woodpanelled walls and low ceiling with a glinting fire safety nozzle. Every night I felt like Sean Connery in the coffin at Slumber's Funeral Parlor in 'Diamonds are Forever'. The walls squeezing in ever closer - what if I'd offended a receptionist? She might turn on the ovens, and stand by with an urn for the garden of remembrance...!So rooms, and bathrooms, weren't so good. You can't do 'good' with those limitations, just reasonably clean and well air conditioned. The rest of the hotel, though, including the staff attitude and service, is fantastic and chic and modernist and inspiring. From the library to the bars, to the skyline views from the trendily underlit roof garden, the whole thing is just a joy to be in after one too many B&amp;Bs or twee country house hotels. Admittedly, the half naked waitresses in the courtyard and rooftop bars were a strange touch to be sure - I really mean it, when we were there girls dressed in a kind of unbuttoned Morroccan jellaba were dishing out the Sam Adams and cosmos. It might sound like a nice one for the [single] lads, but in the midst of a properly swanky hotel it just came off as unnecessarily seedy.Of course, the best thing about this place is the location. You really can do a huge chunk of NY things from here on foot which is so fantastic, as New York is a very underrated walking city by tourists. You can practically throw a tennis ball into the Lincoln Center from the Hudson (which had film, dance and music summer festivals on whilst we were there, most of them free). Columbus Circle's at the other end of the street with all its life and transport links; and, of course, Central Park and the Met Museum really is only a 10/15 minute stroll away. On location alone, it's highly recommended. If, like me, you really need a trusted love one to saw off your legs before you go so that you can fit into the bedroom, then I say do it, just for the barking mad Hudson experience! Of course, the leg issues might negate the strong location plusses for walkers, but you get the idea.PS If you do stay, one of the best Mexican restaurants in the city is just around the corner (the Rosa Mexicano). It's not to be missed - a beautiful place to eat outside or in, with a fabulous menu and incredible cocktails. Amble back to your lodgings drunk and stuffed after a summer night on it's terrace, lucky things!"
Hudson Hotel,Aug 1 2009 ,No space for the shopping bags and offensive service!,"I stayed at the Hudson Hotel with my husband. We were expecting a very small room, which is certainly what we got, but we won't be booking such a small room again. It was so small it was actually a bit of a health hazard. I banged my head on the tv a few times while getting out of bed! The only advantage of the size of the room was that it stayed very hot, so if you want to be assured of a hot room in Nov/Dec in New York book this hotel. Our main gripe was the offensive service from the security guy manning the lifts at the lobby. For some reason he singled out my husband to ask to see our room key, but did not ask any of the other 15 people waiting for the lifts. It was extremely embarassing as other guests noticed what was happening and the same guy did this a few times. We complained to reception and were told that the manager would speak to us the following day, however on returning to our room the following day a tray had been left with 2 bottles of water and 2 apples with an apology note from the shift manager - not an acceptable apology particularly when my husband continued to be singled out! It is disappointing that this incident spoiled our opinion of the hotel as the actual reception staff were friendly and helpful. I have stayed in various hotels in New York and this is the only hotel I would not recommend based on the size of the room and service."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 31 2009 ,Small(ish) trendy funky,"Stayed at the Hudson hotel overnight during a recent business trip to Manhattan (cororate rate). It is a bit difficult to find from the outside so make sure you note the physical address. I was warned about the size of the rooms (particularly the bathroom) before I arrived and the stories were not exaggerated. I found myself wishing to be Alice in Wonderland so I could nibble a bit of the mushroom to shrink in size such that the room was more comfortable. At 6'2&quot; with a decent wingspan, I can honestly say I wasn't too far from being able to touch both far walls...Although the room was small, it was very comfortable for one or two nights. The bed is low to the floor and there is a nice Sony flat screen hung against one of the mirrored walls.Small(ish) room not withstanding, the bigger concern with this hotel is the lighting. I completely understand it is part of the experience the hotel is going for but the common spaces are too dark. Particularly around the check-in desk and the elevator. Sorry, this is a hotel, not a nightclub, please turn up the lights a bit!All this said, if you are like me and prefer a hotel room with character as opposed to the standard Marriott, Hyatt, etc. its worth it stay here for a night or two."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 31 2009,From the moment we entered up the escalator - just fantastic ...,"From the moment we arrived after what can only be described as a flight from hell - we were welcomed in style being shown to the Library for a cocktail to celebrate my 30th birthday. The staff at the hotel were polite, friendly and extremely helpful - nothing was too much bother. The food and cocktails were also superb.I was travelling with my mother as it was a girl's weekend away and when we were shown to our room on the 8th floor ( although people keep saying the rooms are small) our room was fabulous - plently of room for us, luggage and all the shopping that we somehow accumlated ! Ohhhh and the beds and pillows - wow the best three nights sleep I have had in a long time, so comfortable I could have quite happily stayed in bed !Thank you for making our stay so perfect, I will be making sure I come back very soon for a repeat visit and I know my mother will aswell. Highly recommend to all that ask where we stayed !!"
Hudson Hotel,Jul 31 2009 ,Great Location and comfortable rooms..,"after reading mixed reviews on trip adviser I would happily recommend the Hudson hotel NYC. Travelling with a group of friends I saw a whole variety of accomodation and the Hudson was defnitly the best. Located in a great part of town the Hudson is accessible to everywhere. The only downside would be the size of the bathroom but it was manageable. Having a 6'6 tall partner he found it a struggle on the toilet but it was fine otherwise. Comfortable beds, and gorgeous linen. The decor of the room is beautiful. The hotel itself is defnitly worth visiting. The outside patio drinking areas are magnificent and the rooftop bar speaks for itself. Gorgeous! The nightclub seems quite busy but drinks were rather pricey at US $10 a beer. Would defnitly recommend staying here.. but be mindful of the telephone - extreamly expensive. $35 for 60 seconds talk time! better off with a phone card!"
Hudson Hotel,Jul 29 2009,good location - good hotel,"Was a wee bit apprehensive after reading some of the reviews here, however had a perfectly acceptable stay. A public areas, bars, cafeteria etc spacious and cool design. Bedroom was very small - that said for a trip of 5 nights it was adequate. After reading one of the reviews I was concerned that there was nowhere to store luggage or clothes - not true. Closet area is at the door and is &quot;door free&quot; and plenty of room. Small ironing board and iron provided in room (saves having to phone housekeeping!). 1 other small closet with a few shelves and 1 drawer. Room also has a safe and a CD system. Hairdryer in bathroom but yes strangely only soap, shampoo and bodymilk provided so bring your own shower gel and conditioner. Bathroom was tiny - but again it served it's purpose! &quot;window&quot; between bathroom and room - it's a feature - have a look at the Sanderson Hotel in London (part of same group) to see what I mean. TV picture could have been better, but you get used to it, it's not as if it's hazy or anything, just not as clear as I'm used to. Slightly showing it's age in the non-public areas and could probably do with a quick fix of all these little small jobs that we do notice: bedroom door lock didn't work, however doors can't be opened from outside without a pass card plus there is a opening restrictor for extra security. Room service - no more costly than expected from a hotel. Was informed it would arrive in 40 mins, arrived in 25. The macaroni cheese was exceptional. Pizza wee bit less so (watercress is not basil!). Room was facing onto the courtyard and could get a bit noisy at night, but you soon get used to it and I wouldn't say it was a major problem. All seemed to go quiet at a decent hour. I'm trying to pick up here on things that I had read in reviews and concerned me so bear with me if I jump around a bit! Music at reception, wouldn't class it as being too loud plus reception staff were very friendly. The lifts (elevators) had music playing but again I wouldn't have said that this was loud. The corridors were perhaps slightly darker than some garishly bright hallways you may find in other hotels but I would certainly not consider them to be dark! Breakfast was fine but at hotel prices. If you want something cheaper there is a bakery on the corner (1 min walk) plus a traditional diner just across 9th Ave (2 min walk). The location of the hotel was great. It is just next to the Time Warner centre and the Metro (Columbus Circle (59th street)) is a 2 minute walk away. Downtown buses run on 9th Ave 2 minute walk (yes everything is that close!). Cross town buses are one block down on 57th (5 minute walk). Central Park and midtown tourist area are also within walking distance. Always plenty of taxis outside too. If you are travelling from JFK you could use the airtrain then the metro (E from Sutphin Blvd / Archer Ave - this line you would have to change at 50th street or Times Square then take another line up to Columbus Circle, or A from Howard Beach - this would take you directly to Columbus Circle which is 2 minutes from hotel - or maybe 5 depending on your luggage! - note there is an elevator at this station which takes you up to street level). Hope this helps you make up your mind - or allay your fears if you have already booked and have read some of the reviews that I read!"
Hudson Hotel,Jul 28 2009 ,Great Hotel Bad Beds,"Overall the hotel overall was great - location fabulous, staff very helpful and attentive, restaurant and bars excellent - Library Bar &amp; Sky Terrace especially terrific. As expected, the rooms were very small - but the bed was horrible - you could feel the springs. If that could be improved, we would have had a near perfect stay. A few odd things - the glass wall between the bathroom and bedroom was a unusual, but it did cause us to laugh and speculate on the reason for the design. Wins award for the best hairdryer in a hotel room."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 28 2009 ,The best part of my trip to NYC,"I came to the city to escape for the weekend. The kids, the job, the bills, the chores... I came to get away from it all and you couldn't ask for a better hotel to provide that escape. After spending a night, along with hundreds of other cattle at a large chain, whose daughter happens to have the name of a lovely city in France, I was immediately greeted by an out of the box experience. I liked it from the moment I stepped out of the cab, a fiery cauldren literally lighting the entrance to the discreet, yet bold hotel. The gentlemen who greeted us, wearing smart all black uniforms, were extremely friendly and down to earth. Already I felt as though the staff there actually cared about my experience. Entering the hotel you are greeted by a shimmering green &quot;decompression chamber and escalator ride to the main lobby. Again, the staff, was friendly and unique... The decor was wonderfully different, with a wild west, meets Dartmouth College eclectic feel... Every piece of furniture was unique, including the double chairs, which by the way, I saw in an episode of Sex in the City... apparently filmed there... (the affair episode) I also learned that the early years of Sesame Street were filmed in one of the dining areas... (something for everyone at this hotel) The night club area was truly a destination in itself, unbelievable ceiling painting and glass tile lit floors... It was so cool...The room was lovely, with all wood walls, amazingly delicious beds and sheets, I slept better than I ever have in any hotel. The bathroom was clean and crisp and very European in feel, in fact the entire hotel is. When you are in the city, you want a clean, nice room in which you can sleep well...the pillows were better than my own even... The sky terrace made me feel like I was somehow one of New York's elite... which of course I am not...but the wait staff in their adorable summer outfits, were so friendly and genuinely cared if you liked what they served you. How did they get those enormous pots and trees up there? In fact coming home late one night, I was relieved to realize I was close to the hotel, because I could see the greenery from afar... splendid views and outstanding attention to detail. Another small but interesting detail to this hotel, are the elevators.... which by the way, unlike that other hotel...you never have to wait for... the music is just that, not muzac, and the walls are like a sculpted iron swirl... beautiful... on a few of the floors you have access to a large flat screen computer on a georgous marble table... The hallways are dark, but that is part of the appeal... strong, solid, discreet... Really, if you like quality, and an interesting and different hotel experience, you should really come to the Hudson. In reading some of the other reviews, one might be afraid of the comments around size... but what do you come to New York for, to spend the day in your bathroom? Well, even if I had too, I would love it, because that too was squeaky clean and elegant! I would recommend this to anyone and will go back again and again! Thanks for a great experience!"
Hudson Hotel,Jul 27 2009 ,Hudson Hotel - Manhattan,"I just spent a weekend in Manhattan and have been many times, traveling there one is always looking for an affordable hotel. My daughter was able to get me a great price on the Hudson Hotel which has a great reputation. Entering the hotel is a bit tricky because there isn't a sign on the street and you aren't greeted like most hotels but we found our way. you travel up an escalator to another world which is quite interesting. A huge lobby, two trendy lounges, one outside one in, very eclectic furnishings we were very excited to see our room. The hallways are dark and narrow, industrial feeling. The rooms are very very small and industrical feeling. The bathroom is even smaller in fact when sitting on the toilet your knees touch the wall, can't imagine someone who is 6feet tall! My husband and i felt very cramped, if not in bed there is really no where to sit, I don't think I would stay here again. The lounges are very overpriced but typical of NYC hotels, drink prices ridiculous but again that is NYC,. Staff was great, helpful and it's in a nice location."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 26 2009 ,Fabulous stay - couldn't be better!,"Our stay at the Hudson was fantastic. From the moment we entered, we felt like we were in an oasis away from the frenetic pace of the city. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful and the room was serene and comfortable. The location can't be beat as it is very close to 2 subway lines at Columbus Circle, near Whole Foods (great for breakfast on the go) and is walking distance to Carnegie Hall. We've stayed at a few different hotels in the city, but the Hudson will be our &quot;go to&quot; place from now on. It has a beautiful and trendy bar (which is full of life especially on weekends), but the room was really quiet and we were made to feel very comfortable every step of the way."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 24 2009 ,Great location but room small bathroom smallerdark lobby hallway to room,"I was worried too about the reviews on the hotel, but arrived late at 11.30pm( for me 4.30am UK time). I was shattered. I found the staff very friendly the doorman Daniel who went out of this way to help from the time arrived to when I left. Lobby very dark could hardly see to sign the card you have to do.I was on the 17th floor which was nice the landing leading to the room was very dark &amp; spooky.(Only noise was people slamming their doors.)My room has double bed very small room, hardly any room to put your clothes. I was on my own so can you imagine a couple. well for the bathrom it was very tiny &amp; I'm 5' 1&quot; so if you were taller you would have job to sit on the toilet in comfort! for the bath it was tiny too. I laid down in it &amp; had to put my feet on the wall.The room was very clean &amp; as for the bed it was very comfy. Same no tea/coffee in the room as an English person we are use to it. The air con was great as 80's which is very hot of us Brits!!!!!Hudson was in a great location easy walking to places as the subway 2 mins walk to Columbus Circle. This right by Central Park. I would recommend you get a Metro card &amp; put how much you want on it &amp; you can top it up at anytime. Beware subway very spooky with lots of pillars around. Sign post not very good comparing to the tube in London.I would recommend &quot;On board tours &quot; (book from home) which I went on which give you a guide of New York. It was 5.5hrs but worth every $. You go on bus/walk/ferry from Time Square which you can walk from the hotel. I took a yellow cab as so jetlagged. I also went on Helicopter ride with same company it was AWESOME.. Its expensive but worth it. You have pics taken you can buy or not. It did.( You can take pics in the helicopter) I would recommend you going on &quot;Top of the Rock &quot;RockfellerCentre as much better view than the Empire State Building.(You have your pics taken here too buy or not I did.) If you have children you must go the toy shop FAO Swartz its fab so much better than Hamleys in London. Time Square offers you cut price tickets to shows the queues were very long. I didn't get to see the show as only ther 4 nights. There is so much to see but will be back again. I would recommend the coffee shop on the corner called EUROPAN open 24 hrs &amp; will deliver to your room.You come out of the hotel turn left its on the corner you can't miss! Enjoy..... I didn't eat in the hotel or go the bars as expensive.Shopping is very good to as tourist you get a discount at Bloomingdales &amp; Macy's. but you need to go to the visitor place to get it &amp; take some ID. Niki shop(Trump Building) was very impressive on 5 floors. You must take a visit to Grand Central Station to see the ceilings &amp; great shopping cenre too. I hope I have given you a flavour of NY."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 23 2009 ,Good experience,"My husband and I booked this hotel using Priceline. We were definitely worried after reading previous reviews about rude staff, bad rooms, etc. Our 3 night stay here turned out to be pleasant. The staff was very friendly and nice and we noticed this right away. We got there about 4 hours early and they let us pick between 2 rooms that were ready. The rooms are indeed EXTREMELY small, but VERY clean. The smallness of the room didn't bother us, the only thing that bothered us was the bathroom. The bathroom is extra tiny and the toilet is practically pushed up against the wall, so if you are tall then you will have problems. The bathroom was the only thing that bothered us and the only thing that might prohibit us from staying here again. Another plus was that the hotel is close to everything- right near Central Park, 5th Avenue, walking distance to Times Square, etc. One more thing that we appreciated is the Hudson Hotel is near a great hospital (probably about a block from it). I had to make an unfortunate hospital visit while there and it was really helpful it was so close. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you are going to NYC by yourself or with your significant other. It's not a family type atmosphere in my opinion."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 23 2009 ,Very cool place great location great staff - highly recommend,"I was terrified about this hotel after reading the reviews here and I would have cancelled if I could have but I couldn't - and I am SO GLAD I didn't. Wow! We had a wonderful experience.We were greeted warmly and promptly by staff and given an upgrade (woohoo!) to a room with two beds. The room was spacious, clean and had a great view - including the park. The bathroom was also very large and clean. We could have spent a lot of time in the hotel, but, we didn't, since we had plans at a local restaurant and bar and we also took a walk through central park which is VERY close.The location was fantastic - I can't believe people complain about this hotel!The hotel bar area/ restaurant/ lobby was very swanky. It is really a beautiful hotel. I lived in Manhattan for 13 years so I haven't spent a lot of times in hotel there but would stay here again. Since I am a New Yorker I can also tell you that this neighborhood is a terrific location for everything Manhattan. I know people complain about the room size so I would recommend going for the larger room is possible.My only very small complaint is that the hallway sare dark and windy and possibly a bit scary if alone. But, still I would take this in exchange for this fantastic hotel, fabulous location and great staff!"
Hudson Hotel,Jul 21 2009 ,Small miniscule rooms....,"I booked the Hudson due to a market show we were attending for business. Special rate of $149 seemed very reasonable offered through the show. I believe the saying, &quot;You get what you pay for,&quot; applies here.The positive - staff were very helpful. The interior architecture and design for the restaurants and reception area are very interesting (albeit dark) and the outdoor dining spaces are lovely.The negative - Rooms took small to a whole new level. This was the smallest, and most oddly designed room, we've ever stayed in - including all our travels in the US and Europe. Total square footage is 160 sq. feet for their standard rooms - same size as those teeny-tiny rooms on most cruise ships - however lacking all the cruise ship's clever storage areas. The bathroom was so small, all 5'3&quot; of me could hardly move - and I'm described as petite! My poor 6'0&quot; husband just laughed when he saw it. The miniscule tub had very poor drainage and the shower flow was poor. Things didn't look to me to be as clean as I would have liked it.I was told the hotel had been a dorm or women's hostel at some point prior to being converted to The Hudson. The rooms still have that feel although they've added funky lighting.Our joint advice - save your money to dine here and stay elsewhere - unless of course you prefer small, closed spaces."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 16 2009 ,Not bad but don't bother,"Every single person I told I was staying here said &quot;The rooms are so small!&quot;. It's true but not such an issue to me, especially when I moved from the smoking room (bleeuurgh) and the only availability they had left on the first night, to a better corner room on a floor above. Clean and cool.The real problems are the prices and the service.Room was cheap at about $150 per night. But arrived very late and ordered room service, the cheapest bottle of wine was $55. Had an extremely average crab cake and a not bad macaroni cheese for a total of $100. Breakfast is $27 buffet for badly cooked eggs and croissants with lttle relation to their French relatives. Horribly weak coffee I replaced with two off menu stronger cappucinos which turned out to be $8 each, ba-da-bing and you have a $50 breakfast. I refrained from breakfasting there again.But it was the service which was bad. Ages to check in on an understaffed reception. First morning I wanted to ask where the breakfast room was and two people behind the counter continued their conversation without acknowledging me, I waited until I finally had waited so long I tried to interrupt whereupon the lady held up a finger to me and said &quot;One minute ma'am&quot;, very rudely. And one evening when I tried calling down to ask for a wake-up call the phone was literally never answered, three times.It's also a little too much of a scene for me, and I like a scene. Went to the bar with a book on Sunday evening, opened it to a cacophany of music and DJ noise, closed it gently and quietly crept away. That said the roof terrace is lovely so I went there instead and consumed an $18 glass of chardonnay.And I have to say, hotels still charging for wi-fi is blummin cheeky these days and as someone who travels a lot, it's one of my basic standards of a hotel and a good indicator of whether they want to be known for putting customers first. Not here."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 15 2009 ,Great Stay great Location Small but comfortable rooms!,"I was saved by this hotel during my last trip. The last night of my stay, I decided Im too old for my friend couch and a friend and I checked into the hotel by getting a room through Expedia for $160 plus taxes was $200 or so. We booked a standard room, but one the front desk heard about our ordeal, they upgraded us to a queen deluxe? One step above their standard. It was a corner room which was fun. It has a modern design, with cool escaltors, nice lobby with high cielings and greenery. The staff we encountered were very nice and helpful, specially the bell desk and doorman. The room: Yes its tiny tiny tiny but it was perfect for two people. I am told the standard room has a closet half the size of the one we stayed in. The bed pretty much takes up the room, two nice windows, clean and nice bathroom with deep tub. We had a wall with a curatain seperating the room fromt he bathroom. Heard thats not the same in a standard. The Bed- Not too comfortable, but better then a couch. We also had a great time partying it up at the bar/lounge/club that was going on , it was a Saturday. its not that big of a place, huge line and Ive heard its pretty popular to go into. As guests we had two passes, and can bring our friends in ( although at the door they limited the number we could bring). Drinks are expensive!!!! I say preparty in your room or anywhere else, then come here to dance. Great DJ! I would recommend for someone to stay here, only if you are two people. The location near central park, Columbus circle and the subway is also great!"
Hudson Hotel,Jul 15 2009 ,loved it loved it loved it,"after reading on here how small rooms were, i was worried, but we were on the 5th room and i was pleasently suprised by our room. granted it wasnt big but big enough for what you need it for, it was tidy and decor was really cool and different, the sky terrace is a must see views are amazing. I loved this hotel for every different reason, staff are friendly its in a good location, have subway at end of street, rooms lovely and its a nice atmosphere, on a night time the bar really picks up but you dont hear any kind of noise, well we didnt anyway. I would definately stay here again, i loved it! only one peeve i had was having to wait so long to check in. but that was because we obviously came early, we were tired and just wanted to get in room and chill but had to wait, but this wasnt anything to do with hotel, they made sure room was done quickly as they could see we were waiting for it."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 14 2009 ,Wonderful Stay...Thank you David Mc....,"We had a wonderful experience at the Hudson Hotel. My husband has a medical problem and the hotel staff went way beyond the call of duty to accomodate and make our stay very pleasant and comfortable. The staff was courteous, prompt and efficient.David Mc, in the executive office, followed up to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. We were treated like royalty. We highly recommend the hotel for location and ambience. The views from the incredible roof garden are spectacular! This was a 5 star experience !!!"
Hudson Hotel,Jul 14 2009 ,Very Cool Hotel ,I would definitely stay here again when I go to New York. Of coutrse the location was great and the hotel was very cool! The rooftop was amazing and the decor was trendy. Everyone who worked at the hotel was a delight especially the doormen and the people at the front desk.
Hudson Hotel,Jul 13 2009 ,Funky hotel with great NYC atmosphere,"We stayed at the Hudson in NYC for 5 nights - we found it very funky, very fun with a youthful and high energy.The rooms are positively tiny, though this is fine - how much time do you really spend it your room in New York? The see through bathroom's are a bit to get used to, but hey, there's a shower curtain which can block the view. Overall, a great hotel - very happy."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 12 2009 ,Location location location!,"I recently got back from a two-night stay at the Hudson with my boyfriend. Having read many of the past reviews, we knew to expect a very small room and interesting decor. Pros: location cannot be beat! We brought our bikes with us and had a great time cycling around Central Park which is juts a few minutes away and also took them to tour the rest of Manhattan, which is greatly equipped with dedicated bike paths. We had no problems storing them with the bellboys and always had them returned to us promptly. As for parking, we parked for free for the whole weekend on one of the many side streets nearby. It's really worth the extra time searching for these parking spots. Service was great everyone is friendly and resourceful.Cons: We had our room on the 6th floor and unfortunately the windows are not insulated at all and let all sounds in. Therefore we heard everything from the courtyard party as if they were all in the room with us up until they shut it down at midnight. We had breakfast at the hotel on the terrase our first morning, and as enjoyable as it was, it was certainly not worth the 27USD pricetag for a buffet! We instead had breakfast in a small cafe rght on the outside of the Central Park the next day for a fraction of the cost.Overall we had a pleasant experience at the hotel, which was even sweeter as we scored a 105USD dea lon priceline a night, so no complaints there!"
Hudson Hotel,Jul 12 2009 ,A great hotel but for a couple of indiscretions.,"Everything about the place is lovely...however our only real grievances are related to two incidents. Firstly it was my girlfriend's 30th so I arranged for flowers to be delivered to the room, (even emailing weeks in advance, no reply) a fairly easy task, not so I had to go to reception and ask for their whereabouts so the surprise was then spoilt, and I was made to be grateful that they'd arrived at all!Secondly on check out we were presented with bar bill receipts that were clearly not correct, this was disputed and and after promises of correct payment put back on the credit card we were made to chase for the money two months later."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 11 2009 ,Functional nice location decent value,"Stayed at the hotel for two nights recently, here is my honest review:Background: Traveled to New York for business and booked through Hotwire for approx $125 per night. Needed a place close to Times Square, clean, and for a decent price.Hotel:The previous reviews were correct in that the rooms are very small. May be the norm for most hotels in NYC since space is so valuable. The size of bedroom itself is not of issue (at least for a solo traveler) - however, the bathrooms are laughably small.Decor in the hotel is definitely contemporary/chic/etc. Lobby very nice. Hallways and hotel are somewhat dark in nature, but it seems like it's the way it was intended. There were creepy looking lamps on the bedside tables in my room, which were part of the contemporary theme, but I turned them to face the wall and tried to ignore.I did not try any of the restaurants as I heard they were quite expensive and personally I felt like getting out and experiencing other things. I did attempt to get a drink at the Sky Terrace (15th floor) after my meetings one day, however, upon entering the terrace I was told it was going to be closing at 5pm for a private party. This was on a Thursday night! Not too happy with this, I could understand closing off part of it, but the whole thing? I was actually looking forward to sitting on the terrace and relaxing. Not a great business practice.Location is decent, right near central park yet not too far from Times Square. I walked into Times Square for my meetings each day and it was a pleasant 20 minute walk.Staff I found to be very pleasant. I called early when I landed at JFK (8:00am) and they were able to let me check-in first thing before my meetings. Very accommodating and friendly. I asked concierge several questions about subway travel, etc and very helpful. All-in-all, I probably wouldn't voluntarily choose this hotel again, however for the right price could overlook the oddities (I was only in the room to sleep). Families might have a tough time staying here with the lack of extra space, but singles or couple will probably enjoy the atmosphere and ambiance, if you like that contemporary type of thing."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 9 2009 ,Very Chic,"This was a great hotel, No problems what so ever. One of the better hotels we have ever been to. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA++++++++++++++++++++ I could go on but why. Great location."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 8 2009 ,Hated It!,"Without a doubt one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. We had over 60 people there for a conference and not one person liked the hotel. It used to be a college dorm, enough said! Dark halls, beds practically on the floor, couldn't sit straight on the toilet without your knees hitting the wall. Everyone still laughs and talks about what a horrible experience the Hudson was."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 7 2009 ,Dirty room with broken air conditioning after I paid extra to upgrade,"I booked this hotel through Hotwire which was listed $135 one day and it sounded like a good value at the beginning. This hotel has great location and it was only few blocks away from Central Park. When I check in with a buddy of mine, they gave me a 'standard' room which only have enough room for one mattress and no room to sit and no closet for luggage. The shower and toilet is part of room and they are divided from rest of the room with a see through curtain. I came from Hong Kong and I thought I have seen small room before, but this room is by far the smallest hotel room I have seen so far. I guess this setting would work if you are with your lover but it just did not work for us. I asked front desk for a bigger room and they told me it would be an upgrade which at the moment I had no problem to pay extra for a bigger room. After I paid extra $150 a day for upgrade, they put me in a bigger room with two beds. This time we actually have separate bathroom and a closet to put away luggage and cloths. After I checked in to my 'upgrade' room and stayed there for one night, I found following problems:1) air conditioner did not work, the room temperature was at 83 for all night.2) The paint is falling from the bathroom ball3) The shower tube is dirty with human body hair. When I complain to the front desk the next morning when I check out, all I got is 'I am sorry'. I don't recommend this hotel to anyone. I am so glad I was only there for short period of time."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 7 2009 ,We were happy,"As mentioned by others, the rooms are small but we were happy with the location and price of the room. The Hotel is very near Central Park and the subway. Overall a satisfying stay. The resteraunt is pricy but it is NY and there are other options close."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 7 2009 ,Get over the small rooms - this is one great place to stay!,"The Hudson Hotel represents everything that is great about New York. It's proximity to Central Park, theaters, shopping and it's very upscale, chic look is a treat for the senses. It's clean, beautiful and the staff is great. I was impressed with the quality of the food from room service. It was raining so I didn't get to enjoy the outdoor amenities, but I will definitely stay here again."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 7 2009 ,Very Cool,"Great location: 2 mins walk from Central Park, 10 min walk to mid-5th Ave, 20 min walk to Times Square, and a 20 min subway ride to downtown (Little Italy, Brooklyn Bridge &amp; China Town etc). However, there are very few nice restaurants close by so look into it before you go and you won't end up wandering all evening! We recommend Walinsky's Steak House and Gordon Ramsay's for fantastic food (without the Chelsea price tag). BUT of course there are thousands of brunch places 30 seconds away, and a pizza place on the corner open all night (good for post-cocktail evenings!).We didn't eat in the restaurant (too many other cool places to try), but they have two very cool bars in the hotel, although pricey - about $20 for a short cocktail. The Library bar has a large mahogany pool table, and it is quieter than the other bar, and open in the afternoons.The staff were of course beautiful and fairly attentive, dressed in short skirts and low cut tops, and muscle-fit tight t-shirts (this is New York!) but watch for the looks - it's such a cool place it's bound to be pretentious. The only exception to that was the concierge Kyle who was absolutely brilliant and helped us out with fantastic seats at MSG for the Basketball (a must - complete with a corn dog and a Bud Light!), recommendations for a fabulous breakfast (Sarah Beth's overlooking the Park), and booking restaurants and a recommended Jazz Club (Van Guard in Greenwich Village) one evening. Rooms were tiny - we managed to get an upgrade and it was still a shoe box - but that's what you get in NYC. Other than that, the rooms were clean and had everything you would need (though watch out, you pay $7-$14 for water in your rooms, something we're not that used to in the UK). But don't expect a room with a view! Very &quot;sultry&quot; lighting all the way through the hotel - including bars, rooms, reception, lifts and corridors.Usually we like the old hotels with understated sophistication but since we were in New York, we went for the Hudson for a taste of the ultra cool and modern... It paid off, we loved it and felt like (maybe C-List) celebs!!"
Hudson Hotel,Jul 7 2009 ,Does a small room matter ?,"Rooms are woefully small. Even the door to the room was mini-sized. But once inside the room it was chic and neat and noteworthy for its style.Public areas were impressive - great lobby, funky bar, cool library. Wasnt so sold on the restaurant - it seemed underwhelming in comparison to the rest of the place.But a fabulous sky bar !I checked in late and had to shout to be heard at Reception because the music was so loud. But my street cred was higher than the Empire State - I felt like I'd arrived somewhere !If size and comfort of the bedroom was to determine my next place to stay I'd not return. But to be somewhere were I felt 10 years younger and good about myself every time I walked in this is a good option !"
Hudson Hotel,Jul 6 2009 ,Ok if you are on a budget,"We stayed here for 3 nights in May, and had three different rooms. We booked through expedia and felt we were given the worst room as a result (due to the cheap price). The first room was dirty, the second had no safe, the third was fine. To be fair, the staff couldn't have been more helpful.I would stay here again, but the website makes it look better than it is. However, having been to NYC a few times, this was good value for money. If you are on a medium budget and are looking for a reasonable place to sleep, you can't go wrong with this - but the PODis better!"
Hudson Hotel,Jul 6 2009 ,Better then expected and excellent service!,"We'll I'd first like to say that I had read a lot of other posts on tripadvisor of guests who had horrible experiences, but I was pleasantly surprised that my stay was different. I got my hotel on priceline for $115/night, which I think was a great deal, especially for the location! The service was amazing, every hotel person was extremly nice and the front desk man, Jerry, was able to upgrade us to a nicer room because we were celebrating our engagement. The rooms were definitely small, but really... not that bad at all... in fact, I thought i was going to be clausterphobic (and my fiance is 6'3), but it was really nice! The upgraded deluxe room had a small closet/mirror area for our bags and such, so that was really convenient. The bed was alright... the mattress wasnt the best, but it was very clean and housekeeping was done everyday:) We were on the 23rd floor, which I really reccomend because it was very quiet. Overall, I had a great experience, and was really impressed by the helpful staff and the nice hotel room! I probably wouldnt pay more then $180/night though."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 6 2009 ,Very small rooms in a decent location,"Generally good hotel, but the size of the rooms is absurd. THe bathroom was so tiny, even a small person under 5 feet could not sit on the toilet without having your knees hit the wall. A large person would be better off going down to the lobby and using the toilets there. Location is ok, near Columbus Circle, but most tourists prefer to be closer to Times Square, but probably twice the price. THe staff were very friendly all over. THe restaurant prices were insane: $8 for a glass of orange juice, $14 for two scrambled eggs, etc. Other hotels are probably the same though. THe room is so small you could not walk in it at all. THe bed takes up almost the entire area. No real room for luggage, small desk too. Lots of places to eat cheaper not far away, 24 hour diners and a CVS drugstore, a few supermarkets, etc. Subway is 2 minute walk away. My room was very clean and quiet, and everything worked fine. The ambiance is one of these hip stark modern places. the Lobby is very dark. I'm talking really dark, you couldn't see in front of you. It's kind of stupid but i guess that's their plan. There are a few bars that are very popular and crowded at night. Lots of very loud music played in all the public areas, again, kind of dumb, but i guess it appeals to some. It was mostly young people staying at the hotel. There is a terrace on the 15th floor with some views of notthing too great. FOr the price, i think it was reasonable but the small size of the room and bathroom is a real concern."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 5 2009 ,Trendy clean hotel with tiny rooms,"I recommend getting an upgrade if you can. The normal rooms are very small, even compared to the others I stayed at in New York. Very clean, new, swanky feel to the rooms and hotel. Lots of night life going on within the hotel in the Lobby, the bars, restaurant, etc. They may even have a dance club of sorts. Easy to get to and near Columbus Circle, a nice little area to check out."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 4 2009 ,The Kartell Hotel,"Sleek, yellow glowing acrylic everywhere. Cheap rates brought motley crew of tourists. Tiny room is cozy, just big enough for the queen-sized bed. no mini bar. Good location. Great outdoor lounge bar."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 3 2009,Beautiful,"My daughter and I stayed here primarily for museum visits. Very impressed with the trendy decor, friendly service and great drinks. Room service coffee in the morning was some of the best coffee I have ever had. The rooms are small, but well designed with comfortable beds. Loved the design of the bathroom. Hotel was centrally located, the next time we visit ,we will be staying here."
Hudson Hotel,Jul 2 2009 ,Great location!,"This hotel was a great find! It is located in a fantastic spot and was great for the rate. We arrived at about 11:00 pm and the airport driver didn't even know if we were in the right place because there are no signs. We didn't know if we were in the right place because of all the people going to the dance club. We checked in and Sarah at the front desk said she was going to upgrade us to a bigger room to give us some more space. We set our things down in the room and explored the area. There is a CVS and a grocery store right down the street to pick up any essentials and an awesome 24 hour bakery 1 building down called Europan that we went to about 10 times in 4 days. When we came back, a hotel employee asked us for our room keys to make sure we were guests before we got on the elevator (which was an awesome thing). The hotel is a 2 minute walk from the Columbus Circle Subway station and about a 4 minute walk from Central Park. We could get to the southern most point of Manhattan in about 20 minutes! The room was exceptionally clean and we had room to put our suitcases in the large, walk in closet. The bathroom was a standard bathroom, nothing special except the design of the sink was cool! The bed was very low to the ground and the pillows a bit tiny but it was comfortable. The TV control didn't work great but it wasn't a big deal. Our room was always spotless when we got back. The only thing I would caution is that it is a very lively crowd at the bar. The music was going until late. It wasn't bad but we were on the 4th floor and had to get up early to go to the Statue of Liberty. I fell right asleep though. The Sky Terrace is beautiful and we wished we could have spent more time up there. We wanted to order a pitcher of Sangria but just ran out of time. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel. The rate was reason enough for a hotel centrally located in Manhattan and the location made it awesome! We could get anywhere we wanted to go. A great deal!"
Hudson Hotel,Jul 2 2009 ,Party hotel not for sleep in,"We spent Saturday and Sunday night on the 12 Th floor. There was a band playing so loud, it was impossible to sleep before midnight on Saturday night. Anyway, the hotel has no acoustic isolation. You hear everything from the street.Beautiful lounge, very small rooms with air conditioning extremely noisy.Never again !"
Hudson Hotel,Jul 1 2009 ,Not family friendly and not comfortable.,"Let's start with the good points. The staff was fairly friendly. The look of the hotel is very cool. The sky terrace is very pleasant and a great place to unwind or have a drink in the evening. The location is excellent - a short walk to Columbus Circle and the subway, and there are taxis aplenty. The bad. This hotel is extremely loud on the weekends because of the bar and hosting of private parties. The hotel staff was less than honest with us about when the music would end, though they did give us ear plugs. The rooms were very small. Granted, you don't need alot of space for a bed, but we had trouble finding somewhere to put our suitcases. The bathrooms also were very, very small. I was several months pregnant and was frustrated that the tub did not have a ledge to sit on and there were no bars to hold on to in the shower. If you have a disability, consider those points or ask for a handicap accessible room. The bed also is very low to the ground. The hallway smelled like mildew. The room was less than clean. Some days housekeeping gave us new shampoos/conditioners and some days they didn't. You have to pay for internet access.All in all, if you have kids, like to sleep, or have any type of disability, consider staying elsewhere."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 30 2009 ,Great position  small room .,"Stayed here for four days - great position near Central Park . I'll simplify this into + &amp; - .+ Good position for all sights , Rockefeller Centre , Empire State , 5th Avenue , Broadway , Times Square , Central Park , Bloomindales - Macys too far to walk . Booked a bus trip before we went - brilliant , see a lot , saves walking, and you can get off anywhere you want and sightsee - make your own way back . . Booked Statue of Liberty before also - need a full day for this - more security than the airport - what a joke ! Try 8th Avenue tons of cheap places to eat ~ £35 for 2 with wine ( I've put £'s in as it was 2 to 1 when we went ).I'd book this place again as it was within walking distance of all the sights and a good standard of hotel - good disco - need a few quid though .Safe at night to walk round , I'd say London is more dangerous .You've got to visit Abercrombie and Fitch on 5th Avenue, had to queue to get in ! - four floors of disco music , have to shout to ask where stuff is - brilliant clothes and cheap .Breakfast - little cafe on the corner £7 for two of you - mix with the locals - it's great!- Need to book for at least four days as you will spend the first day getting there , some people went for two days and consequently only had one full day and night and were going home on the third day .When you get to the airport don't bother with the phones for your shuttle - they all speak some weird combination of spanish/american , couldn't understand a word- go to the desk - they will sort you out . Hotel is expensive £7 for a glass of wine , I went down to the corner shop and got a six pack of Bud (£4) to drink in the room -what a cheapskate , I'll say it for you !Smallest hotel room I've ever stopped in but had everything in it .Don't take coats - waste of time - just tops and jeans ."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 29 2009 ,Dont go there,On the negative side: The worst business centre in my 15 years as a business traveller.On the negative side: Long lines for check in and check outOn the negative side: AC not working for two days in a rowOn the negative side: Remote control not workingOn the negative side: Keys not workingOn the negative side: PricesOn the negative side: NoiseOn the negative side: No mini barOn the positive side: Staff - friendly but unable to solve problems
Hudson Hotel,Jun 28 2009 ,Trendy...but no room!!,"We stayed at the Hudson for 5 days as last step pf our honeymoon in the States. I'll try to describe our opinion in a few words... The hotel is very interesting from an artistic point of view.It's very stylish, the furniture well studied and placed, peculiar lights ( which hardly show you your way, believe me!). The reception is beautiful and so is the concierge desk.The bar inside is also beautiful, with Kartell furniture, a glass floor and it is always crowded with people, mostly well in their thirties, well dressed and very early in the evening,when they just come back from work. The hotel is very popular among stylish and young people as a restaurant and for its terrace outside... We wanted to enoy the newyorker atmosphere so we did not mind the loud music in the afternoon till night.we had dinner at th erestaurant, which struck us for being so DARK... I just tell you that I had to ask for three candles ( one by one...at last I must have sounded quite annoyed for that), because I could barely see what I ordered! The food was good, but we just tasted it, never seen it and in addition to that wine bottles were extremely expensive ( almost everywhere in New York ) and the menù choice was very poor...so I would not recommend the restaurant personally.Let's come back to our check in. We arrived quite late and tired, about 21.30..and surprise..we were left at the reception where we had a seat waiting for our room. This all took more than 40 minutes, how come? we booked our room and it was late in the evening, why shouldn't it be ready??? At the very first sight the room caught our eyes because it is very &quot;minimal&quot; and &quot;well designed&quot;...but we suddenly found out how small it was.Extremely small! The room is actually just a bit wider than the bed itself ( not a proper double bed), plus a mini closet ( filled with the safe and a hi-fi), a desk and the again extremely small bathroom. I must say everything was clean, but no space for our luggage at all!We had to put it over the bed during the day to walk around the room ( hitting continuosly the tv, the desk, and my husband ..). The bathroom was also trendy, I liked the shower which was separated by the bedroom from a transparent window with a stylish curtain.The position of the hotel is very good, well served by public means and surrounded by restaurants, fast food, internet cafè and drugstores. The staff was quite ok, especially the guys/girls employed at the concierge desk.I don't know what my review might suggest you, but I would recommend thi shotel just for young couples and people, to people not looking for much relax ( it's loud ) and expecially to those who appreciate interior design. I don't think it's place for families or older couples at all! It's trendy, it's fashionable, it's cool...but in one word it's not comfortable to stay intheir rooms!"
Hudson Hotel,Jun 26 2009 ,Stay here at your peril,"The Hudson was to be the last stay on a whistle stop tour of America for our Honeymoon. We had previously visited New York two years ago so were coming here to chill out and relax, do a bit of shopping before coming home.We arrived at the Hudson late (11.45pm-ish) after a delay from San Francisco). We were greeted by a mute doorman who offered no help or assistance. Considering we had two huge suitcases, hand luggage and coats to drag up an escalator, lit up by neon green/yellow lights!!We were tired and just wanted our room. We queued for ages in the dark, depressing foyer with the sound of thumping music ringing in our ears. Unbeknown to us, the bar adjacent to the lobby and situated above the escalator was a nightclub on a weekend.Oh joy, arrive at hotel looking less than glamourous, tired and confronted with scantily clad young socialites boogying around me - not impressed. Can barely hear the receptionist but do hear that they have upgraded us as we are on our honeymoon. She asks us to let her know if it is noisy and they will try and move us tomorrow. We assume they are talking about the banging sound from behind us.How wrong were we......After cramming in the lift, which also played music - how wonderful!! (NOT) we arrived at our room - or should I say cupboard. There was hardly room to swing a cat. This is the smallest room I have ever seen. It basically is a bed in a room. Room doesn't describe it as there is no room. The floorboards were coming up from the floor. The only cupboard had a draw which was locked a speaker in it, which was fallen off and a safe that could be completely lifted out!! No room for clothes. The bathroom was disgusting, dirty and tiny. My 6ft 1 husband could barely go to the toilet.We were also confronted with the most awful noise. We assumed it was the air con unit - it was not. After turning it off we discovered we were positioned over 2 extractor fans outside, which not even the air-con could drown out. This was the noise they referred to and there was no clear indication before we came up here that this is what we would be presented with.The whole room was depressing, in fact the whole hotel was. Apart from two very helpful staff members, the rest were simple, rude and unhelpful. One even offered us earplugs for the noise!We asked to check out and was told that we could but they wouldn't be able to refund us as we had prepaid through a travel agent. We had no option but to stay. We couldn't afford to upsticks and move.We were moved the next night to a further upgraded room. Room in same condition, slightly bigger than a postage stamp this time but added bonus of door almost falling off its hinges. Neighbours who slam door on the hour, every hour and drilling in the morning.To top it all off, unable to have a bath as plug doesn't work. Not that I wanted to really, because it was filthy.After a further discussion with the manager, we were moved again for our final night to a Junior Suite. This room is the same size as a standard sized room in the previous 5 hotels we had stayed in. One of them was a Best Western and a 2/3 Star. This hotel apparently is a 4 star - In my opinion it does not even rate higher than a 1 star.This is by far the worst hotel I have ever set foot in.Unless you are 21 and with a group of mates whose main aim is to go clubbing and you don't care where you sleep - DO NOT STAY HERE. You will regret it.These 4 nights completely ruined the remainder of our honeymoon."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 25 2009 ,This place is a wonderland!,"My boyfriend and I spent a night at The Hudson, and we were wowed by the entire place. As soon as you enter the hotel, you feel like you are entering a dream! The atmosphere is a lucid dream! The accomodations were superb... the food and drinks were fabulous... and the staff was friendly and helpful! So much to do in just one place. Rooftop trendy bars to Cozy Library Lounges! Just Awesome!"
Hudson Hotel,Jun 25 2009 ,A nice place to stay,"We stayed four nights at the Hudson and had a great time. The hotel is in a great location, yes the rooms are small but we were in NY to see the sights not spend great amount of time looking at the room. The only problem we had was that the bath kept backing up and what looked like soot made the bath look black. At first i thought it was me cause i had a long plane trip but the second time i knew i wasn't that dirty :) Overall nothing to complain about."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 24 2009 ,HORRIBLE HOTEL EXPERIENCE,"One of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. We arrived on a late flight, exhausted we took a cab to the hotel. Once there, there is no signage, just yellow escalators going up. The doormen did not even bother to help us with our bags, instead just stood there. We dragged our stuff up to the lobby/ bar area (which is huge and extremely dimly lit, as if your inside a club with music thumping everywhere you go) We stood in a long line (at midnight) and once we got to the desk, we find out the computers are down. We had to wait another half hour to get a room. Nothing was offered to compensate our waiting. Once we finally got a room, it turned out to be the tiniest room ever. (this was the superior room not the standard room- which made me wonder how small would the standard room be??) Our AC didnt work, and we had to call for maintenance at two in the morning. (it broke down 2x after that) There was no fridge or ice bucket either. Basically a room with a bed. We tried to get out of the hotel but unfortunately could not because we booked online via a hotel website. The wake up calls we requested every night never rang on time, our last night there we almost missed our flight because we NEVER even got a wake up call !! I am a former new yorker now on the west coast traveling back often. There is nothing special about this hotel. It appears to be trendy but is overrated. There are definitely better hotels in new york if your looking for a trendy hotel. The bar is overpriced and most of the clientele are uptight suits or Europeans. The location is near a subway station, but being on 9th avenue it is not so convenient if you plan on doing tourist things. You are on the outskirts of Hells Kitchen. I also noticed certain things in the hotel seemed very old and dirty, such as the lobby bathroom and the hallways. The staff did not appear friendly, only offering you help if you asked for it, instead of being naturally helpful. The rooftop waitress was slow and snotty. This was definitely one of the worst hotel stays I have ever had. I do not recommend this hotel for anything. The worst part of the hotel was definitely the small room."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 24 2009 ,Trendy Hotel with Small Rooms,"It was difficult to find the hotel entrance, as it is not marked. The whole experience reminded me of a modern speakeasy. Just a door with a number, but once inside, an escalator takes you up to the second floor where you can check in. They have a great courtyard for cocktails (pricey tho'). The concierge was extremely helpful, and the decor was pretty amazing. My only real complaint was that the rooms were extremely small. Great for one person, but for two it was a tight fit with barely enough room to walk around. Also, no desk to work on was a detriment.Overall tho', for the price and location, it was a very good deal. In fact, the subway is a block away and central park is two blocks away."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 23 2009 ,fine...trendy lobby if you are into that,"It was fine. The bit about the small rooms is over the top on here. They are small but it is fine. If you are traveling on a long trip with two large suitcases, it might be different but for a weekend ti was fine. We booked through bid on priceline and were happy with the price. It was convenient to the subway and had some eating options nearby. Central Park and others convenient but that is obvious. I don't think staying up here has the charm of other neighborhods though. Pay for internet isn't great and tv was not great. Windows opened and that was nice. Bathroom was small but who cares. Shower and go out, that's why you came to new York."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 23 2009 ,will never stay here again,"ooo... first - after I booked I was told by many &quot;good luck&quot;. I chose to ignore that...HUGE mistake. room - ridic small even after an &quot;upgrade&quot; for more $$. no drawers, no real closet space, no place to out anything - so you trip all over it. cabins on ships are small - but better appointed so they stay comfortable. I dont expect lap of luxury - but i dont stay at a hotel to be less comfortable then my own bedroom!my keys never worked, the movies didnt work, the room service was a bit overly priced even for new york, and no mini bar. Oh - and I am a small 5&quot;5 female - and my knees hit the wall when I pee and the only way I can shave in the shower is to leave the shower curtain open and get the whole bathroom wet!Like I say - I have seen better heads on a small boat!There is NO WAY I will ever stay here again. EVER.And I will re-consider staying at Morgan hotels period... I want style and comfort and service do not believe any are mutually exclusive."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 21 2009 ,Great Mother/Daughter Getaway!,"Over this past spring break, my teenage daughter and I stayed at the Hudson for two nights. From pulling up to the hotel from the moment we left it was a magical time! The staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful, the food in the Hudson Cafeteria was awesome, the atmosphere was etherial, the room was so cozy and cool and we were so close the the subway and all of the stores that we wanted to shop in!The amenities were fantastic! We plan on returning once a year for an annual shopping and relaxing time together. My daughter said,&quot; It was the best time ever!&quot;"
Hudson Hotel,Jun 19 2009 ,Stylish hip hotel beautifully designed public spaces and very helpful friendly staff,"I stayed in the Hudson hotel after checking out early from the quite appalling 'On the Ave' hotel on a weekend visit to New York with my partner.After enquiring at the front desk, we were told that there were rooms available, but that they couldn't match the discounted rates we had seen on their website, though handily pointed out there was an internet cafe around the corner from the hotel if we wanted to book online.We had intended to book a 'Loft Room' but as non were available booked into a 'Double Double'. The room was lined with dark wood paneling and came with modern furniture, desk, chairs, flat screen TV, HiFi music system and an iPod dock. The room seemed freshly decorated and was incredibly clean, the beds were very comfortable and the bed linen of very high quality.The public areas of the hotel were all well designed and had a modern urban look. Although it has been open for some time now, the design has not dated and is well maintained. After a days shopping or sightseeing it was a genuine pleasure to return to this hotel, every single member of staff I had contact with was genuinely friendly and seemed concerned with ensuring guests had a good stay. At peak times there was quite a long line at the front desk, but a cheerful member of staff managed this, speaking to those waiting and ensuring everyone was kept well informed and that no one cut in. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. After having such a poor time at my first hotel (On the Ave) the Hudson hotel and its staff turned around my weekend and made it one to remember for all the right reasons and not all the wrong ones like 'On the Ave'."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 18 2009 ,Great Hotel,"My mom and I just returned from spending 4 nights at The Hudson. And yes the rooms are very small (but you are warned), and there are curtains that separate the shower from the room, (if you pull both curtains it is plenty private), the bathroom is tiny, tiny, tiny, but the bed was so comfy, besides we didn't go to NYC to stay in our room. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and didn't make us feel out of place by being older (the staff is gorgeous). Two days before our trip was over my mom fell and fractured her foot (not at the hotel) which meant she had to leave early, the front desk notified the security office who brought a wheelchair to our room and rolled her out to a taxi. The also brought a refrig. to our room so that my mom could keep her medicine cold. They went out of their way to make our trip memorable. Right down the road is a subway stop which made it very easy to get all around the city. I would surely recommend this hotel to anyone. Go to The Hudson and don't worry about anything but enjoying your trip."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 18 2009 ,Pretentious,Studio had sufficient hanging space but no drawer space at all. Furniture is tired and shabby. Bed and linen fine but room only cleaned once in the week after a request. One day no hand towels provide but arrived after a phone request which is more than can be said for a light bulb which I asked to be replaced on Thursday and again Sunday - then gave up. The whole place is dark so the light bulb would have been helpful. Only one electric socket worked and no sound on most of the TV channels. Handy for subway without having to change.Disappointing for the cost and only would be enjoyed by those who hadn't stayed in a good hotel before!
Hudson Hotel,Jun 18 2009 ,Horribly odd experience,"We arrived at the Hudson excited for our New York adventure to begin. We checked in without any problems, and the staff were relatively polite. We got on the elevators which seem abnormally small only to get to our hallway which was dark, dirty and a little scary. The carpets seemed old and there was a weird stench in the hallways. It was a scene straight out of a cheap horror film - I was waiting for someone to jump out and start chasing us (that feeling never went away). We got to our room and opened the door only to find that it was TINY. The entry &quot;hall&quot; was not even the width of our luggage and we had to move them in sideways to get them in the door. The bed was extremely low to the ground, close to the walls on both sides, and not particularly comfortable. There was one small table in the room that we had to move to the closet to be able to accomodate our stuff. The bed faced the bathroom, which enabled you to literally see (thanks to a glass wall) the other person in the shower and in the bathroom itself. The bathroom was so small I could almost turn on the water in the shower, use the toilet, and brush my teeth simultaneously (not even an exaggeration). My husband and I could not fit in the bathroom at the same time. My husband, who is 6'2, had to use the toilet sitting sideways because his knees would hit the wall in front of him - it accomodated me but I'm only 5'2. It was SUPER loud and noisy at night and we had trouble getting to sleep at night. I guess it's a big party place sooooo the party happened just as we were retiring for the night from our long day out. Air conditioner sounded like a swamp cooler in that small room. The positives were that it was conveniently located and had easy access to the subway. Staff was accomodating when our flight was delayed and held our room/reservation. I'm sure this is just a hip new atmosphere I'm not familiar with, but I'd never stay there again."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 18 2009 ,Romantic Weekend ...........,"Celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary weekend at the Hudson was an extraordinary experience. From the moment we came up the awesome escalator to the reception/ lobby with its endless ceiling covered in Ivy the welcoming staff made certain our stay would be as special as the hotel itself. Our room was cozy and had all the amenities one needs for a comfortable stay. Hudson's location is a plus too, since you are steps away from Central Park, Columbus Circle, and close to the Broadway theater district and surrounded by great shopping. Although we live in NY, we will return to the Hudson for that special getaway."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 18 2009 ,Great atmosphere location and service,"The Hudson is one of my favorite places to stay. A terrific value as it is right on Columbus Circle, close to Central Park. The atmosphere is fun and hip, with a diverse mix of european and american vacationers, as well as business people. The nightclub is always going strong, the outdoor terrace is cozy, and the Library bar is the perfect place to sit and talk. You can't go wrong being this close to Central Park.W.S. Langley"
Hudson Hotel,Jun 17 2009 ,Highly recommended,"I visited the Hudson Hotel with my girlfriend at the beginning of June. The rooms are small, but extremely comfortable. With all the horror stories I've heard about dirty hotel rooms in NYC- the Hudson was such a relief, the room is incredibly clean and well maintained.The Hudson Bar was such an amazing place to hang out in the evening, it's a really upscale night club with great music, drinks, and the atmosphere is really unbeatable. The ambiance of the entire hotel is just one of a kind and you come to appreciate it really fast.The hotel is really trendy, and if even for a couple days- it really makes you feel like a celebrity or someone special.The breakfast was a little pricey, but well worth it- the food at this place is second to none."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 16 2009 ,color ful,"it waas colorful n bright hotel.we syayed in a standered double room,it was a good room,with city, courtyard,river view,double bed,wi-fi, flat tv,in room spa serviece,the bar was good with nice interior,cafereria ,library were really very gud.there was a private park with antique and modern garden furniture. i really liked the sky terraces Located on the 15th floor, it is the perfect combination of sweeping city and Hudson River views"
Hudson Hotel,Jun 14 2009 ,Maybe I just got relatively lucky,"I stayed at the Hudson last weekend for 3 nights. Before I booked this hotel, I read about other people's experiences on Tripadvisor (good and bad), but I was staying there alone so the idea of being in a small room didn't concern me, especially as I knew that I wasn't planning to spend a lot of time in the room. Also, I got what I considered to be a relatively good rate, so I figured I'd give it a try.The lobby is impressive, and the girl who processed my check-in was efficient and very friendly. When I got to my room on the 12th floor, I was pleasantly surprised. (By the way, yes, the corridors are dimly lit but they're not so dark that you can't see where you're going - unless you have glaucoma, possibly.) In my room, there was plenty of floor-space around the decent-sized bed, and room for a desk and chair. There was also enough space to store my suitcase. The room was clean, and the bedding and towels were of good quality.There was a dock for my i-pod, which was a nice addition. The air-conditioning worked well - it was rather loud, but I found that I didn't need to keep it on overnight, so it didn't affect my ability to get to sleep. So, yes, the room was small but it didn't feel claustrophobic.The bathroom was much bigger than I'd been expecting - there was a bathtub/shower, and it was twice the size of the bathroom I'd had when I stayed at the Algonquin earlier this year. Also, the bathing products were lovely, although a shower cap would have been a useful addition.The bars in the hotel are busy and loud, and the action goes on until late. I didn't fancy the very loud and funky bar, although I would have liked to have had a drink in the Library Bar, but it was too busy and there wasn't room on the night when I looked in.The only negative event I can report was when I went to have a drink in the open-air courtyard bar. It's a good space, and a nice place to sit and enjoy a drink if the weather's good (in theory...) It took me 10 minutes to attract the attention of a waiter. I asked him if I could have a Bombay Sapphire and tonic - he just shrugged his shoulders and said what sounded like, &quot;I don't know&quot; and then he said something unintelligible. (Perhaps he wasn't a waiter - just someone who was passing my table, dressed as a waiter...) Anyway, after about 15 minutes, no sign of any drink, although the faux-waiter was still wandering around, looking useless. So, I placed my order again with a waitress, and got the drink I'd asked for. A little later, I asked the waitress for the check. She went away... and didn't bother to bring me anything. After 15 minutes of waiting, I grabbed a passing waiter and told him I'd asked for the check - he said he'd sort it out. He came back and said, &quot;The waitress will bring your check over in a moment.&quot; A further 10 minutes passed and that waiter eventually brought me the check. So, frankly, to have to wait 25 minutes for someone to bring the check is just rubbish - especially when they're charging $15 for a gin tonic.So, that was frustrating and annoying, but other than that I didn't really have much to do with the staff, as I was only using the hotel as a place to sleep. Everyone else I dealt with, I have to say, was pleasant and efficient.Given that other people on this site have been outraged by the size of the bedrooms and bathrooms at the Hudson, I wonder if I just got very lucky, because I didn't have any problems with my room at all. Or maybe my expectations were just very low..."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 14 2009 ,Loved It,"I stayed at the Hudson this week and loved it. Yes it is small....almost laughably, (especially the bathroom) but it was clean, had a great bar, perfectly centrally located and the staff was friendly and got us in our room well before check in time. It is not a hotel for a family. I found it very sexy, but a little dark in the hallways. I will definitely stay there again."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 12 2009 ,boutique hotel needing a touch-up,"I just stayed at the Hudson over this past weekend. Loved the minimalist entry with no exterior signage and escalator up to check-in. Lots of brick and wood which made it very dark. Curved brick on the corners with a brass statuettes on top - cool detail. You could tell Starck and the designers were trying to create a feel and mood. But it does need touching up in paint and lighting in some areas. It looks like the novelty might getting a little old.The check-in could be more efficient. Waited in a long line and the room wasn't ready. After coming back to get the room and waited in a longer line, we got our room. The room was on the 5th floor which probably was (or still is) a smokers floor. We were in the shoebox room for 30 minutes and my wife had to call to change rooms. We then moved downstairs to a larger room which was at the end of a 1/4 mile walk around 3 hallways. Other than these room issues, we really didn't have a problem. The shoebox room was the same in other reviews - shower curtains, no leg room on toilet. Both rooms had wood paneling and flooring.The 2nd floor courtyard had a great outdoor patio with bar. You could tell that this was a neighborhood hangout. Lots of people that just came to party on a Sat. night. But who drinks $16 martinis?? We did on our last night. And the 17th floor roof deck had a great view down 9th Ave and 57th and 58th. Wished we took advantage of that deck."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 12 2009 ,The worst hotel I have had the misery to experience almost anywhere.,"This hotel was so bad that my wife and I woke at 4am, called another hotel made a reservation and had moved there by 6:30am.The rooms are absurdly small. The first room we were given was almost completely filled by an ordinary queen bed. (Side to side and end to end, one could just get down either side.) The bedroom looked, through a window, into the toilet (very chummy). We insisted on a move to a larger room and were given the largest. It was slightly longer than the first, a console table acted as a desk and cables trailed across the space behind the chair where one had to walk to get to the window.The aircon did not work, made a lot of noise but no cooling. One window could theoretically be opened but the sash was broken so I propped it open with one of the amenity boxes.The corridors are narrow, painted black or dark brown (impossible to tell) and lit by dim strip lights above the room doors. The person who showed us to the second room could not read the room numbers sign and sighed in frustration. The entire hotel is dark, even the reception. The room corridors are cave like. When I checked in I was kept waiting for quite a long time even though two desk staff were not dealing with clients but fiddling with their computers.When we checked out (admittedly 6am) the desk clerk could not give us a bill. We had to trust that the charges would be correct. They were.My guess is that this building was originally a public housing project. The windows at least have not been renewed from the original construction. My impression was that the building has had a cheap conversion. The staff were indifferent, some gave the impression they did not want to be there.If you are a troglodyte who does not suffer from claustrophobia this might be the hotel for you. By-the-way, it is not cheap."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 12 2009 ,The Hudson Hotel Bar THINKS its cool but is NOT,"The &quot;bouncer&quot; at the front bar area of the hotel (not to be confused with Library at the back area) was so rude to my friend who happened to be wearing flip flops, and wouldn't let her into the bar. Now, I can understand certain establishments having a dress code, but this is the Hudson Hotel, not 1 Oak, not Tenjune, and certainly not fancy by any means. Further, she wasn't dressed sloppy or unprofessional. And what really made me upset was that there were several other girls in the bar area wearing flip flops. If you're going to enforce a ridiculous dress code, at least do it uniformly. Its too bad that the service was so awful, b/c I liked the decor and the drinks were good."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 11 2009 ,Past its prime terrible front desk staff check-in was a nightmare,"Stayed here on a June 6th given I had plans to to go to dinner and see a show. The Hudson seemed beat up to me. The finishes, the furniture -- all seemed beat up and tired. What was trendy early this decade just looks threadbare now. Tried to check-in at about 4 pm and told the room wasnt ready...huh?...and this was after waiting in a line for 30 minutes. So went to the bar for a drink (watered down, the most expensive glasses of juice I've ever had. If a drink is approaching $20, you can at least put some booze in it.) Anyway, called back the number on the card they gave me and was told my room was ready....a Deluxe King that I had booked directly on their site. Went back inside, and after waiting again in the 30 minute line at the front desk, was told that the King Deluxe wasnt ready but that the Queen Deluxe was. Since I had dinner reservations, I couldnt argue too hard, and asked if there was a lower rate for the smaller room. Nope! According to the front desk staff, both rooms are the same class.....ok, whatever. Also asked explicitly to be away from an elevator, and where was I placed, at the room closest to the elevator bank. Ridiculous. This hotel is all sizzle and no steak. Ive stayed in other boutique hotels in NYC and this was by far the worst. Not recommended.,,,,"
Hudson Hotel,Jun 11 2009 ,Average,"We stayed here for our 2nd part of our honeymoon. Coming from an amazing hotel in Vegas to the Hudson was a complete let down. The whole room (inc bathroom) was the size of our bathroom in Vegas - no joke! However, I had been warned of the room sizes in NYC so I tried to get over this.Once I got over this disappointment, it started to grow on me though. I still don't know whether I would stay here again but overall it wasn't too bad. The smell of smoke in the hallway and also in the room was horrible and we also had some kind of generator outside our room window which was very loud. Also as we were only on the 5th floor the noise from the bars below was really bad a few nights so if you are looking for a good sleep it is probably not the best place to stay for you.The location of this hotel couldn't be better, this was probably my favourite thing about the Hudson. It was so handy for lots of places.It could be doing with a lot more lighting as I hated the dark reception areas and even the room was dark. I like a nice bright room, I found it a bit depressing going from the nice weather outside into a dark hotel. It made it feel dingy."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 10 2009 ,lacks warmth and character,"not impressed with staff, rooms kept clean,good location, try losing those few pounds you want to , just to fit into the rooms ! only person there with a smile and good day was doorman,"
Hudson Hotel,Jun 10 2009 ,Comfortable and fun!!,"My colleague and I had meetings all over Manhattan, knowing every clients' 1st question is...&quot;Where did you stay?&quot; we wanted to have a good answer. So we stayed one week at the Hudson hotel in a Double Deluxe room. The beds were soooo comfortable, everything was always clean when we came back from a long day of meetings. Shacazia at the concierge desk also was so helpful, by the end of the week I was hugging her goodbye, incredible service, she would do just about anything for us to make sure we were situated well. Then the night club had a really nice scene, I worked it out in advance with the concierge to be able to bring my clients into the night club for a few drinks thursday night, the place was hopping, not too jammed packed but filled with fun people having a good time."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 9 2009 ,Small ,"Stayed over on a Sat nite. Not only was room the size of a shoebox but a soon as you get out of the elevator the smell of cigarettes almost knocks you out. That same odor follows you into the room. I must say that the bar scene at nite is great! But for the money you are better off picking another hotel. The only time I would recommend is if you hooked up at the bar and wanted to get a quick room for some fun. Actually, at the front desk I saw quite a few people trying to do this! One person even asked do they rent out a rooms by the hour."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 5 2009 ,Average At Best,"Needed a quick room for one night in New York so I tried Priceline for the first time and got the Hudson. I've been in their public spaces, but this was my first overnight stay. Staff was helpful and polite, but the room was a joke. Tiny doesn't describe it - it was unbearable. I like to relax in my hotel room - but you couldn't do it here - there wasn't even a place to sit. The bathroom was so small that I actually had to dry off out side of the bathroom after a shower (BTW - not hot water - front desk admitted that it's an ongoing problem).Bottom line - great public spaces but make sure to upgrade your room or you'll be very sorry."
Hudson Hotel,Jun 5 2009 ,worth every penny!,"Ok, it is a quite expensive hotel. But worth every penny. We booked with 50% discount during a 24 hour sale (2 months before our stay!). The rooms are very small but very clean, and design. We love stylish places to stay and this is definetely one to recommend. The bars are amazing and the drinks even more. The staff was friendly and checking in and out was never so easy. For a stylish stay in NYC I'd recommend this Hotel. p.s. there is enough space in your room for all your shopping goods ;-)"
Hudson Hotel,Jun 3 2009 ,The trendiest hotel with the smallest bathroom!,"Cool hotel, great shared space, bar , restaurant, library, garden etc.. Good thing I'm not a big person as my legs almost hit the wall infront of the toilet when seated. The room had everything that was necessary for 1 person, but it was not encouraging to stay in the room as it had minimal space and no comfortable sitting area. On the other hand there were lots of other places within the hotel to sit and enjoy even if you just wanted to sit and read. GREAT people watching!!"
Hudson Hotel,Jun 2 2009 ,It was AWESOME!!,The hotel was great. Fantastic location...close to EVERYTHING!! The rooms were small...but hey its NY...what do you expect? The night club was the best. The staff was super friendly. The tv in the room was a little fuzzy but hey i didnt go to NY to watch the TV. I would definitely stay at the hotel again.
Hudson Hotel,Jun 2 2009 ,Terrible Hotel,We stayed here on business/pleasure and found it extremely noisy. It felt like you were sleeping on the street below. Unbelievable! The windows are paper thin. We moved to a high floor where it was supposed to be quieter - it was not. The room and bathroom are so small you can hardly move. We previous stayed at the Westin Times Square (same price). What a difference! Would never recommend the Hudson to anyone. We travel frequently to all parts of the world. The staff here do not care about your experience.
Hudson Hotel,May 31 2009 ,If I could live there I would...,"I am happy to say that the HUDSON hotel was part of the experience of my first trip to NEW YORK city. I've had work colleagues and friends stay @ the HUDSON and yes the first thing they say is the rooms are not big. It's New York. Space is a precious commodity. With that said I was more than satisfied with my room. I was in NYC to explore the city, not scrutinize the pro's and con's of my room. It's a room for sleeping, storing your belongings, and showering. I had seen the pictures on-line and on the hotels website, and they do not do it justice.As I walked up to the front door, I felt like I was entering a bunker of hip and cool.The front desk staff were pleasant and efficient. The day I checked in, there was a young woman (named Talya (sp?)) that had the most electric smile, you could have powered the island of Manhattan! The recommendations from Ben at the concierge services was so bang on for what I was looking for.The hotel is perfectly located near the south west corner of Central Park with Columbus Circle Stn. in between. From there, you can catch the subway or walk to anywhere on the island and beyond. The neighborhood itself is safe and clean, even for New York standards.I ran into a couple of bellman on their coffee break at one of the local Starbucks and felt like I was chatting with friends. We joked about sending someone with a toolbox/repair kit to my friends room to mend a broken heart and we all had a good laugh. It's nice to know there are some nice people in NYC and they work at the HUDSON Hotel.I will most gladly return the to both the HUDSON and NYC, as well as definitely refer the hotel to friends and family. Jeremy Vail"
Hudson Hotel,May 31 2009 ,Loved it once am booking again!,"After 3 months of solid internet searching to find accomadatiion in NY I kept going back to my first choice - The Hudson Hotel. Mr Starke's imput helped my decision of course. We were blown away the minute we arrived. Great public areas (we arrived very early and had a few hours to wait to check in so we sat in the room with the posters of cows in hats - so cool - and pool tables). When we finally got to our room it was everything I wished for, including the view from our window. Even the bad reviews about the room sizes didn't put me off. Why do you need huge hotel rooms? Obviously the reviewers who complain about that haven't been to Japan! You go to New York to experience the city not the inside of a hotel room. And if you need more space go to the reading room or the terrace. We are heading back to New York in September 2009 and I will not hesitate to book this hotel again. Can strongly recommend the Clift in San Francisco too. Now that's a beautiful hotel! I have recommended this hotel to many as it captures to unique vibe that can only be found in a city like New York City."
Hudson Hotel,May 30 2009 ,Seen anything smaller???,"The very dark entrance after taking the narrow escalators was the first uncomfortable feeling.Entering the room was a big surprise. Harly larg enough to accomodate a bed , a shower and a toilet.The additional problem was that we had difficulties to find a place for our traveliing bags. Only two pieces. We were making a two week round trip. To both myself and my wife she got a major attack of clautrofaubia. I will save you the details but whilst I was trying to get a larger room ( tree upgrades wes still small) she left the hotel and it too me quite some time to convince her to come back in. And I can tell you , we are experienced global travellers, including travelling into remote en poor area's en staying several days in a tsmall train coupé. This hotel is even not a joke anymore.Check your bills, particularly at breakfast. I had to complain twice for overcharging and I heard another person having the same problem. Talking to a waiter , he told me this was routine as they assume 90% of the people take a full breakfast. This is an easy way to make money , but stealing in my opignon.Certainly no value for money."
Hudson Hotel,May 28 2009 ,The Worst Place I Have Ever Stayed! EVER!,Not too much else to say.This place is a joke. the hallways are filthy. Rooms are so small you hit your face on the wall getting out of bed. Horrible. Absolutely awful.
Hudson Hotel,May 28 2009 ,Disaster,"Stayed in one of their suites: boy oh boy where do I begin.The lighting: where is it? The room was so dark, we could not see anything. The shower: what shower? it trickled water, it took us each maybe 30 minutes to get clean.The hallways: felt like we were lost in hell trying to find our room. The smell of pot was everywhere. The hotel needs some major work, it feels really run down. I don't know why anyone would stay here. Would never stay there again period. Would rather stay at any NYU dorm room which is what it felt like."
Hudson Hotel,May 27 2009 ,Tiny rooms but very cool overall.,"Tiny doesn't even begin to describe the room size--luckily I am petite and was staying alone, so I just found it funny. However, if you are more than 6ft tall or planning to share a room, I'd try for an upgrade beyond the standard room. My 6'3 husband would have had a panic attack from claustrophobia! That said, everything about the Hudson screams cool. When you're in NYC, you're not usually spending much time in the room, so a small room is not really a big deal. The bars are unbelievable, especially the 15th floor terrace. It was a little chilly for May, but they had blankets to keep you warm up there so you could still enjoy the amazing view and great cocktails! Had a light dinner at Cafeteria, good meal with great atmosphere, albeit super dark in there."
Hudson Hotel,May 26 2009 ,Hope it's better next time :(,"I stayed here this past April for business. I was happy overall because of the proximity to meetings I had to go to. The location was fabulous, with central park and loads of restaurants. The staff were all friendly and well mannered. However, my room was atrociously small and VERY, very noisy. I get anxiety in small spaces- and this was just beyond tiny. It did not help that I had to wake up in the morning at 6 with no sleep. I had to do this for four days. I have to be back here/ same hotel in June and really hoping they show some compassion and give me a quiter room so at the very least I can sleep :("
Hudson Hotel,May 25 2009 ,Great location/Great doormen/Great Sky Terrace/Tiny tiny tiny,"After many trips to NYC,and hearing legendary stories about the Hudson bar, this was my first time staying at there for a mix of business and pleasure over the Memorial Day holiday. First impressions were spectacular. The doormen were awesome-cute, muscular, and polite. Helped carry bags out of the taxi. The green escalators carted you away from the craziness of the urban scene into the dark tranquility of the Hudson. The lobby was well-appointed as was the Hudson &quot;cafeteria&quot;. However, $30.00 per person for breakfast was too much. Tip--go to the restaurant on the corner and get 2 eggs and a sausage for $9.00 bucks. The concierage staff was the best. The guys were very helpful. Interestingly, none of the staff looked over the age of 30! This is a place for the young and the beautiful (or the bold and the beautiful) (and the foreign tourist from Europe and S. America). Seriously, if you're over 50 years of age, consider another location. Mom and Dad wouldn't fit in here. I saw one couple in their 50's on the Sky Terrace--they looked liked divorcees and looked they were trying to be cool with the young guns. (It wasn't working and they soon departed.).On Monday, around 7 PM Eastern I was greeted by the song &quot;Me, So Horny&quot; pounding in the lobby for the annual Monday night blowout party. Acccording to the DJ: &quot;Monday is the new Friday&quot; at the Hudson?!! The young and the beautiful crowded around the velvet rope.The hotel staff was very cool and very accomodating. Now--the rooms. I started out in a tiny , smoking room on the 6th floor (I had booked non-smoking), but got upgraded to the 11th floor larger non-smoking room at no extra charge. The lamp on the tiny desk was broken in the first room and the lamp cord had been spliced together with tape! Scary! The engineer said that &quot;more of these lamps were on order, but hadn't arrived yet.&quot;? The second room was MUCH better until the AC quit on the last day. It took 3 phone calls until Engineering finally showed up. The engineer stated that &quot;the fuse blew out down the hall&quot; and corrected the problem. You don't hang out in the rooms here. The clausterphobia will get to you within an hour. Basically, Ian Schraeger needs to bust down some walls and join some of the rooms into one to give more breathing space--but I'm sure that would cut into profits?. Note: The rooms are smaller even than the boutique hotels in Paris.The fitness center looked pretty nice. The Sky Terrace bar had a terrific view. The cocktails were good, but the bar tenders seemed a bit &quot;green&quot;. I kept waiting for Kim Catrall and Sarah Jessica Parker to show up at any moment. Finally, the place is very, very dark. It's soothing, but really I couldn't see far in front of me in the hallways. More light would be helpful especially to those of us in their early 40's. The location is &quot;the ace&quot;. 2 minutes from Time Warner and Central Park. 10 minutes to the Theatres on Broadway and 46th. Would I come back? Maybe, but then again I might want to try another place also."
Hudson Hotel,May 25 2009 ,I will recommend this hotel to everybody I know! Fabulous!,"I couldn't have been happier with my stay at the Hudson. From the moment I arrived, I felt very welcome. The staff was friendly, helpful, and truly dedicated to providing a comfortable, warm environment. The Hudson is home to the Hudson bar, but the noise from the bar cannot be heard from the guest rooms. Also, there were several other more intimate spots to sit and enjoy a cocktail.For me, the room was just the right size. The hotel is centrally located and in walking distance of many fantastic restaurants, shopping, and the bright lights of Broadway. Additionally, there was a drugstore right on the corner...just in case!I loved my stay....I'll definitely return. Thank you, Hudson staff!"
Hudson Hotel,May 25 2009 ,Absolutely one of the best Hotels' in the World-Just do it!!,"I arrived into NEW YORK full of excitement and anticipation of a City full off new age vision, passion and enthusiam for living life.This Hotel is exactly that..Fantastic..blew me away and I was so impressed it was a highlight of my trip no doubtClean, compact rooms, minimalistic in approach but the overall Hotel was so impressive, room size was not a deterent-{perhaps not practical for a family} The roof top terrace is awesome and the views breathtaking-the night life was incredible and the Bars in the Lobby are Sensational.What ever you do if you want to get amongst the New York wy if life-this is the place to do it!!Hooray for Hudson!!"
Hudson Hotel,May 25 2009 ,Sleeping in a box,"I've stayed at the Hudson for one night during a business trip. The location is good, the service was definitely ok - but the rooms are not reasonable in size. It's not just that the room itself is only very very slightly bigger than the bed (if you actually look at the images at the hotel site - you can see it). It's that in the bathroom you can not sit on the toilet without having you knees bump the wall. The shower is also very narrow. The hotel has everything you need and the service was fine. If all you plan to do is sleep there - you can get away with it. But for a slightly longer stay or for two people - I wouldn't go there."
Hudson Hotel,May 21 2009 ,midtown's best hotel all across the board!,"I stay at the Hudson every few months and absolutely enjoy my experience, each and every time- it is truly my home away from home! The staff know me by my first name and acknowledge my repeat business with great service. The location is perfect and in walking distance to so many great places. The staff are very friendly and the property offers everything I require for comfort and convenience. There are great rooftop patios and the restaurant (that used to be the set for Sesame Street) has great hours and really good comfort food.I have recommended the Hudson to many friends who also thoroughly enjoyed their time there.."
Hudson Hotel,May 19 2009 ,Smallest room EVER!,"I travel to NY 12+ times a year and am used to small rooms, but this room was barely bigger than a walk in closet, and the bathroom was virtually impossible to use and I am only 5'8&quot; tall. I felt that any price for this room would be over-priced. Lobby is impressive. There is NO sign or address on the outside of the building that I could find. That may be a cool statement from the hotel that this is a trendy property, but as I walked there from another location it was difficult to find and that is not user-friendly."
Hudson Hotel,May 18 2009 ,Bijoux room,"I was highly curious about this hotel as all the magazines raved about it and I wasn't disappointed. If you get pass the fact that it is the tiniest room that I stayed in NY, it is charming. I found the staff friendly, especially the guys on door duty outside the hotel. Certaintly not stuck up like some places.Reception could have done with more people to cover the volume and set up a queue as quite a few people jumped ahead of the line, which makes you angry as their arrogance.I dined in the restaurant, sitting on the side table opposite the kitchen, watching the chefs cook. The waiters were very attendive and helped me with choosing my meal. What I didn't like were the cleaning staff knocking on my door at 8am, they kept asking me what time I was leaving the room and I would like a lie-in during my holiday but I felt like I should hurry up and get out so that they could do their job.In the evenings, the queues for the lifts were huge, they should set aside lifts that are specifically for guests and not for the bars in the hotel. Also they could have better lighting in that section of the hotel as it's extremely dark!Otherwise I enjoyed my stay, its close to the subway, central park, the mall and if the price was right, I would definitely stay again."
Hudson Hotel,May 16 2009 ,Nose bleedingly expensive yet ambience of a hostel,"I wanted to be near the Lincoln Centre and was there for 8 nights. I had booked a studio at average $430 dollars a night plus multiple taxes. The so called studio was extremely small and dark with no lighting in the seating area. The toilet sported some pubic hair. I was upgraded to a suite which was much better but rather tired in its decor.The queues at reception were extremely long so making an enquiry was not a quick process.The bar charged $18 ($20 with expected tip) for a glass of house chardonnay and so I never ventured to the restaurant.It was clear the hotel caters for a young clientele and there was a very loud disco bar at night tho this was not a problem as my room was quiet but it puts out of use the rather nice library bar (where one could use one's laptop during the day tho it was impossible to read as, like with the whole hotel, the lighting was extremely low verging on darkness).The saving points were: the location with a good local diner and the Time Warner Centre nearby and some of the staff particularly those who helped with luggage.Overall a never again experience"
Hudson Hotel,May 15 2009 ,Great location and shower heads but the rest gets a C-,"Three nights over a weekend in May 2009. Too expensive for what you get. Converted chopped-up apt. bldg surrounding LOUD bar courtyard. Noise still a problem at 14th floor (we set the A/C to &quot;fan&quot; to block noise. Worked because the headboard IS the A/C unit!!) Tiny, tiny, rooms, almost laughable, but there is a vestibule for luggage. But awful queen mattress.  Desk staff OK but the WORST doorman in NYC. And I mean the worst. Great for party animals that drink like fish but the ave. temp in the bars both nights was upper 80's, no joke. Weird."
Hudson Hotel,May 14 2009 ,fun unique and corteous,"The hotel is really fun. It is definitely not meant for families, but rather for friends and couples. There are 3-4 bars in the hotel, all completely different from one another. The hotel entrance is fairly simple, and there are no markings from the street to let you know what the building is - you just assume you're in the right place based on the address. All you see when you walk through the doors are 2 escalators, one going up and one going down. Once you do get up to the lobby, it is totally different from what you'd expect. A huge open space with brick walls and arched pathways to the patio, greenery and wooden chairs of all different shapes. The patio bar is beautiful and very relaxing, while the restaurant is like something out of medieval times with thick benches and high-backed throne armchairs. The rooms are tiny, just big enough for a bed, but they look nice, clean and comfortable. The staff is wonderful. They are friendly and helpful, welcoming without being overbearing. Everyone we had to deal with, from the check-in desk to the bell boy, to the waiters and cleaning staff was very professional and nice. Overall, this was a relaxing haven in the middle of the concrete jungle. Whether you want to rest or party, this hotel has it all, including a great view from the sky-terrace."
Hudson Hotel,May 14 2009 ,The Hudson can be hit or miss. Miss and miss big time hit and you're alright!,"As you will see by the various reviews from Trip Advisor, a stay at the Hudson can be VERY hit or miss. I have stayed there perhaps ten times over the years, but hadn't been there for a few years, and found the hotel generally the same.If you are a group leader, (and I was in this case as I was bringing a group of people to New York to do a commercial--I was the producer), you are almost certain to have some angry folks. As an example, in the case of the job that brought me out there...I, had a great room with a triple upgrade that was very tasteful and roomy. My only problem was when the hotel internet went down for almost 12 hours. Oh, and the main light went out in the entrance to my room that they replaced....three days later. And on my last day, the key machine broke which meant that everytime I had to go back to my room, I had to wait 10 minutes for a security guard (I checked out early and moved to another hotel). Nonetheless, I had a good experience there.My executive producer checked into a room...that had blood on the sheets. That didn't go over so well for him, or his wife.My director moved out after one day as her room was dirty upon arrival and had some kind of air conditioner/boiler that kept her up all night. &quot;Enough,&quot; she said (and she says she has never checked out of a hotel before where the rest of her team was staying at).Our other five guests didn't complain...only the most important ones to me! So if you are a group leader, you are BOUND to get complaints as there definitely are problems with the hotel...whether the size of the room, whether the service, etc. We had room upgrades for our room, or I would have expected more complaints as the botton tier rooms are so small that if you eat a Hostess Ho Ho, you'll fill the room and won't be able to move.As for service, it can be very hit or miss.One day we had a challenge with one of the folks at the front desk and any other hotel would have fired her for her rudeness (and we're actually very easy to please...but the hotel staff isn't trained in classic hotel management, or if they are, most of them have not read the manual as they're out at casting calls and auditions during the day).But in a Four Seasons &quot;yes sir, yes maam&quot; &quot;my pleasure&quot; kind of way...don't expect that.The reason to stay at the hotel...??. The entire lobby area, restaurant, outdoor patio area is fantastic. Very cool. Great bars and common areas.I will say that in the bar area where they have the restaurant, there is a bar with only ten seats, and often they have three bartenders behind the small bar....who....are so entertained by themselves that it takes a good amount of work to get their attention...and they're only eight feet away from you. They're nice, but....not attentive. But it's still fun to sit there and mingle. And the food in the restaurant is good, especially the comfort food. And if you don't mind the $27 buffet breakfast price, the breakfast buffet is nice.And if you do have a nice room, it will never be large and cavernous (wasn't it once a former YMCA?), but you might luck out. Don't count on it.Also, it's in a great location, only one block from Columbus Circle and Central Park, so you can't ask for better than that. That's one of it's best attributes. Move this hotel to anywhere else in the city and ... it would have closed already.And the price can be great....which is what led us back there.Would I go back again? Yes, but...it would be depending on price, but I wouldn't bring a group back as it's not worth it if they're unhappy and complaining.As you can see from Trip Advisor, the hotel essentially doesn't even bother responding to guests complaints. The hotel can be fantastic for some, and a disaster for others and that's simply the way it is at the Hudson. If you go in expecting a toss of the coin, you won't be surprised. Hopefully you'll get lucky!  Wishing you all good luck...."
Hudson Hotel,May 14 2009 ,I love to stay at the Hudson - but I wouldn't pay rack rate,"I love to stay at the Hudson. I love not knowing where it is until you're right up on it. I love the huge flower pots. I love the peek-a-boo shower. It feels so New York to stay there, and adds to the ambience of every part of the trip.That said, I only stay there if it I get a great deal. Every insult is also true. I don't think you could even sit on the toliet if you were overweight. And, my favorite, the last time I was there they charged me $19.95 for something... which wasn't there on check out. Okay, sure, except I really didn't take anything or eat anything, etc. But I didn't care enough to call and have them remove the charge, it's just something I still remember...The last time we were there DH and I went for the most lovely nighttime walk. What college is there? It's a charming neighborhood and the hotel is hip and fun. The New York hotel market is crazy and you could do a lot worse just picking from a hat."
Hudson Hotel,May 12 2009 ,Wonderful,I booked this through the priceline bid website....and then read the trip advisor reviews....and was prepared for the worst......I don't know where these people stayed because their reviews were not present the hotel we stayed in! It was so good we paid the full price for our room to stay another day!From the moment we checked in the service was excellent.....we had an non smoking room...8th floor kingsized room and yes it is small but it is NYC.....so you don't spend much time in the room.....it was clean with a shower and loo....yes its compact....and only seperated by glass walls but there are shower curtains for your modesty......We used the bar / night club it was cool yes drinks are expensive....$30 for two....but it was funWe had breakfast...it was excellent.....$58 for two but well worth itMy husband lost a cufflink it was found and sent on to us.....and I rushed out of the room and left the safe open...loads of cash...passports and jewlry nothing was touched....What more can I say? New York in no longer a cheap place but then what city is? Still very worth while to visit and a great hotel......try it and enjoy!!!!!!
Hudson Hotel,May 10 2009 ,Tiny Room - Great Location - Poor Service = What we expected for NYC Hotel!,"We had a queen room and I totally agree with all the reviews that the room is very small. Not so bad except in the bathroom. If a very tall person stayed here, they could not sit on the toilet without their knees hitting the wall!Location was great. Only 1 block from subway, Near Central Park. Service was not great. Second day, they only left one washcloth. We got back to room about 10pm, called and asked for one. They said that they would send right up. 30 minutes later - we had to call again. When it finally arrived - almost an hour after the original call - they delivered a towel - not a washcloth. Third day was a repeat of the second... except this time they did not leave any washclothes. Trendy. Got for about $120 on Priceline, so it was well worth the cost."
Hudson Hotel,May 7 2009 ,Great location Smiling staff Clean small rooms,"The escalator takes you up to the dark and trendy Lobby and lounge. There are no signs - the Check-In desk is facing you. The concierge desk is to the right. NOTE: Not the best place for children since the lobby converts to a lounge at night and or course, the escalator. The staff was wonderful - I was allowed an early Ck-in (11:00) Easter Sunday and had additional days booked. The young woman arranged for the same room for all 4 days. Wonderful since I needed to shower and change before Sunday dinner at 1:30. My room (1808) was small with no frills, but very clean. If you are accustomed to living in small spaces (boats/RVs) then it's great for a couple. I stored my bag under the bed. In fact the bathroom is so small that reminded me of the boat I once owned. (see photo)Internet is extra and costs $10 per day. That was fine since I got the room on Priceline for &gt;$100.Location is superb - on Metro lines at Columbus Circle and across the street from Time Warner and Jazz at Lincoln Ctr.There is no complimentary breakfast, but just next door is the Europa cafe with b'fast foods and sandwiches."
Hudson Hotel,May 4 2009 ,location fantastic friendly staff,great hotel in a fantastic location especially for first time visitors to NYC or anyone who wants to stay in midtown. great location near the park and columbus circle subway which gets you everywhere. staff really friendly and efficient. lobby is fab. bar is gorgeous if not a bit pricey! only downside is the rooms are quite small.
Hudson Hotel,May 4 2009 ,Friendly staff and perfect room for the occasion,"The service at the hotel was unbelievable. When I explained the special occasion my fiance I were celebrating the upgraded our bedsize and also gave us a high room with river views. It was absolutely wonderful. While I agree with many reviewers that the rooom is quite small, I found it to be a very cozy small. I did not find it anxiety provoking and it was nicely set up. The lighting in the halls was perfect. The only weird thing was the window between the room and the bathroom, although a curtain could be closed. It may not be ideal for extended stays in New York, but for short stays I think it would be perfect."
Hudson Hotel,May 3 2009 ,lobby location good rooms are small,"Lobby and lounge is very trendy and good, however rooms look old and small. Internet is extra and costs 10 $ per day. Hotel is very close to Central Park and Time Warner building.There is no complimentary breakfast.Service is below average."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 30 2009,The Hudson was great - we really enjoyed our stay,"Before booking this hotel I was put off by various reviews; some saying about the tiny rooms, noise factor, it being dirty, however I know that some people are harder to please than others so I took a chance!I stayed for 4 nights with my Mum and we loved the hotel; the location was perfect for Central Park, 5th Avenue and Columbus Circle tube was nearby. We thought the hotel was gorgeous to look at with beautiful furniture, and 'outdoors inside' feel and a great, lively bar for drinks/dancing. They also have a roof terrace and a huge outdoors space with seating, beds to lounge on and helpful staff. The room was small but we found it perfect for us; I don't think anyone goes to NY to chill in their room do they? It was all very clean too.I would definitely return!"
Hudson Hotel,Apr 28 2009 ,If you want somewhere purely as a base this place is great!,"After reading the reviews about The Hudson prior to our trip we were slightly concerned what it was going to be like! From the minute we walked in the door we knew that those reviews were probably from people that expected far too much this hotel. The staff were very friendly and accommodating (we asked for a high floor so we could enjoy the views!). Yes the rooms are small, yes the bathroom is on the small side but how big do you need the room to be? Are you in NYC to see the inside of your hotel room? I'd agree with people that said that The Hudson could do with a lick of paint but overall we had a great experience. The Subway is literally around the corner - and don't be afraid, people are so helpful!It was NOT noisy as people suggest, they may have just had an unlucky stay, but we were there 4 nights and we couldn't hear a thing apart from a couple of sirens, what do people expect staying in the middle of Manhattan!? Go stay in NJ if you have a problem with it!The only thing that I would say is that it would have been nice to have breakfast included but there are plenty of places close by! It would have also been nice to have A/C in the room as it was 90 degrees this weekend! It would have also been nice to have WIFI included, I thought $10 for a day on top of your bill was a bit steep.Stay here if you want somewhere as a base, it's not a place to take young children or your grandma but it is great!"
Hudson Hotel,Apr 26 2009 ,Great location hotel not so great,"On the up-side: 1/2 block to Columbus Circle, subway station, Central Park. You can walk everywhere on UWS, to Central Park, to Broadway shows. Check-in/concierge/bell staff were very pleasant, charming and chatty. I got a good deal on Hotwire for 6 night stay.On the down-side: Bar scene (especially on wknd) was very loud for my 6th floor courtyard room. Room was the tiniest I've ever stayed in anywhere in the world. Bathroom was so small anyone over 5'6&quot; couldn't sit on the toilet without banging their knees against the wall. Also, shower stall (no tub) had a glass wall facing the bed which might not be appropriate for all travelers - lovers yes, friends and/or family no! Room and bathroom were so dark I couldn't apply my make-up. I called Maintenance 3 times as the fire detector in my room was hanging off the wall by its wires and no one ever came to fix it."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 23 2009 ,Completely overated,"Arrived late in the evening - no bellboy, rude check-in staff. The bar was so noisy you couldn't even talk to the check-in staff and be understood. Asked for and got a top floor room - superior room, no larger than a broom closet. Bad lighting, tiny, bouncy bed. Terribly noisy, even though on the top floor. Certainly would never go back there - all decor and no substance - was not built to last. Not value for money, even in New York terms."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 23 2009 ,would not stay here again,stayed for 4 nights bathroom so small my husband had to sit side ways.cleaning not very good no loo rolls and didnt clean room they said they would do it yhe next day but we were going home. tips grat deli on the corner outside very reasonable and great food.try red eye for a good steak.
Hudson Hotel,Apr 22 2009 ,Nice staff slick lobby HORRIBLE HOTEL,"The lobby is cool. The restaurant and bar are fun. The staff was pretty nice. Everything else: HORRIBLE. The halls are creepy and dark and made me feel sort of unsafe. And when we reached the room itself, it only got worse.If by some misfortune you are ever put in room 549 of the Hudson hotel RUN DON'T WALK find other accommodations. It faced a hideous and NOISY view of the air shaft and generator. Hot air blew out of the vents even when we put on the air conditioning, shooting the temperature up to an intolerable 85 degrees. Plus, I'm a vehement nonsmoker who was put on a smoking floor. As soon as I realized this, I went back down to the lobby to politely ask for a change in rooms and was told that nothing else was available. So I woke up at 2am gasping on my neighbors second-hand smoke and was unable to fall back to sleep for the rest of the night. Upon checkout, I made my displeasure known and the manager--who, like the rest of the staff, seemed nice enough by NYC standards--comped a free night in one of the Hudson's Deluxe rooms. Honestly, I had such a terrible time there that I don't think I could bring myself to go back--even for free."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 21 2009 ,Tiniest Bathroom Ever!,"The hotel is very hip and trendy. You'll feel more like you're at a nightclub than a hotel. The room was nicel decorated and clean. The size was decent for a NYC hotel. However, the bathroom is a whole other story. It is actually the sole reason that I cannot recommend the hotel. It is absolutely tiny. I am a rather petite woman, but I could not use the restroom without my legs hitting the wall. I have had tall friends who have stayed here and they had a horrible time for this very same reason. On top of that, you better be traveling with someone you know really well because the shower shows through the room."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 20 2009 ,Excellent hotel!,"I stayed at the Hudson in March 2009 for one week and it was great. I cannot agree with all the negative reviews here, I had a great time at the Hudson. I was not sure if I should stay at this hotel prior to making my reservation, but it was totally worth it. My room (Superior) was not as small as I expected from the reviews, there was plenty of room for my stuff (same goes for the bath). The interior of both foom and bath was very nice and stylish. Same goes for the design and architecture of the lobby, the bar, the library etc. Everythig looked just perfectly stylish.Another point that seems to get negative feedback is the music. Again, I do not agree. First, music can only be heard in the lobby and the elevators. Second, the music is not loud at all (don't believe the reviews talking about &quot;disco noise&quot;). Third, I did not hear any music from the lobby in the hallways or in my room. In contrast, my room was super quiet. Another thing I really liked about the Hudson is the location. It's only a couple of meters away from Central Park and I went there for a run a couple of times in the morning. In addition, I found the Hudson to be an excellent starting point to discover the city by foot. The staff at the lobby was also very friendly and helpful, e.g. had very good advice concering running goods.The only thing that gets a negative feedback from me are the prices for everything extra like drinks, breakfast, lunch etc. But then again, there are so many cool and nice locations in the immediate neighbourhood (check out the bars/restaurants/cafes on 9th Avenue), so this didn't really affect me.I highly recommend this hotel and would go there again for sure."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 18 2009 ,Not a happy experience,Stayed for four nights in March. 25 minute queue to book in while staff chatted behind the counter and seemed not to notice guests. Areas of the hotel very gloomy. Bedrooms so small that the wall-hung television could caused bruising. Not something I would repeat voluntarily.
Hudson Hotel,Apr 16 2009 ,Better off visiting for a drink than staying here,"I stayed at the Hudson in the wintertime after visiting the hotel several times just for drinks. The decor of the bar area and restaurant are just fabulous, the perfect place to go for a martini and mingle/people watch. But as far as staying there, besides being in an excellent location blocks from Central Park, the rooms are TINY!! Not that anywhere in NY you do very well on size, but I've found these &quot;trendier&quot; places are usually especially small and the amenities and rooms feel older, and they spend all their money on the common areas. Better off just coming from a drink."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 15 2009 ,We got what we expected,"We were a party of 9 with an average age 60yrs staying for 4 nights over easter break. Bit apprehensive after reading other reviews but we need not have worried. Rooms small - yes, but actual size is given on hotel website so no surprise - how long are you going to be in room anyway. Able to hang clothes, store suitcases, use bathroom and shower fairly easily - not sure how tall some of the other people leaving reviews but we had very few problems. We requested high floor rooms so did not have any noise apart from some street noise which you will get in any NY hotel. Staff were great, from front desk, concierge, bell hops and doorman - helped every time we had a query. Pricey to eat and drink at hotel but Flame diner on corner of 9th ave serves great breakfast and rest of menu looks good too, open 24/7. Good Irish pub restaurant on same street (Coliseum) serves good food and drinks and Kennedys around corner on 57th st great value for money in their dining room at back of the bar. Ideal location with Columbus Circle subway just on corner and Central Park on next street."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 13 2009 ,It is a shame handy location but extremely small rooms would not go back,"I am not a picky traveler by any means, but I feel so strongly about this, I am compelled to write a review and I never write reviews. If you are thinking of staying at this hotel, don't. When people say these rooms are small, they are NOT exaggerating. We booked this hotel for 100 a night plus taxes through Priceline, it came to about 133 a night. We felt it was a good deal at the time, considering the location was so great, near Central Park and Times Square. However, by the time you add 55 dollar a night parking fee, 10 dollars for Internet and then the room size, this is no deal at all. The room can not accommodate more than 1 person walking around at a time. The bathroom is so small you have to sit sideways, or your knees hit the wall. The shower is of course also tiny, you can't move around without rubbing against a shower curtain or wall. Rooms were not filthy, but could have been cleaner. The closet was so small, you can not put any luggage in it, so you have to put your luggage around the bed and then you cant walk around the bed. If someone sits at the desk, you can not get to your luggage, etc. The bed was low to the ground, hard and not comfortable. There is no coffee pot or refrigerator in the room, but there is an iron, hair dryer and a little ironing board, good luck finding a spot to iron. No bathroom counter space, or good area to do hair/makeup. The rooms were not sound proof, kind of noisy, could hear neighbors, people walking up and down the hall and street noise. The lobby was really beautiful, very unique, but once you get on the floors, they are painted a dark gray with yellow lighting and is very dark, not a great idea for safety's sake. When checking in/out there was always a huge wait. The staff was pleasant enough, once you got one of them. When I brought up the issue of the small rooms to the staff, they responded by telling me the hotel rooms are suppose to have a &quot;cruise ship&quot; feel, please. Sadly, that is the best thing I can say. Next time I would stay out of the city and/or pay more for a better room, somewhere else. Also, I would not use Priceline again either, I would not say that was a 3 and 1/2 star hotel, not even close."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 13 2009 ,Great Location and that's all,"I was pretty excited staying at the Hudson given the location and the funky website. I arrived very early for check-in but finished the paperwork with the front desk staff and was able to leave my bag on hold. The hotel reception area/restaurant has an amazing ambiance. Beautiful! The Room:HATED IT! It definitely ONLY provides the bare basics. I believe I was in room 964. There was about 5-7 inches (barely) of walking space between the bed and the surrounding wall. The view out the window was great but although I kept it closed, there was a distinct draft that kept me shivering at night and since its so close to the main streets, there was A LOT of street noise that was very disturbing. The mattress was hard and uncomfortable. The bathroom was cute but again - cramped! You literally have to sit on the toilet in an angle of to the side since there is not enough space between the wall and the toilet to sit straight. Decent for the location of the hotel but I like a good night's sleep and therefore, won't be staying here again and is why I am giving this hotel an average rating. The staff were excellent. I really want to recognize this aspect of the hotel because although I wasn't satisfied the room, the service was enough to keep me content without complaints."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 13 2009 ,Some problems but overall was a cool hotel!,"It was our first time to the US so we were in awe of everything anyway. We got to the hotel and it looked fab! The room we were in was facing the Hudson river and it was clean and was big enough for the both of us. Who wants to stay inside when your in NY anyway!! After a 7hr flight i wanted a nice shower but the shower head wouldnt work, i went down to the front desk and they said they would send maintenence up. The next day and nothing. I go back down and they apologise and upgrade us to a bigger room! Although we only have the view of the inside of the hotel (i.e other windows!) the room was a great size. We ordered room service and although slightly steep in price it was a one of stay and the food and service from the porter was fantastic! It was ashame my partner was only 19 at the time so we couldnt get a drink in the brilliant bar/club but thats US laws! Overall the hotel looked amazing, the service was great and i would definetly recommend this to anyone. It is central to most things...walking to broadway etc. Or taxi journeys too."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 13 2009 ,Good location but..,"Stayed at this hotel for two night. Location is great. The standard rooms are tiny (was expecting this but did not realize quite how small.) and more suitable for 1. They do however contain everything that you would need although in my room the TV was not working &amp; it was not as clean as I would have expected, I went to reception to complain &amp; all issues were dealt with promptly. The bar is great and the restaurant nice - food is tasty and filling. For me, the hotel was quite good value but I found an internet deal."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 12 2009 ,The atmosphere at the Hudson is dark and the rooms are tiny and uncomfortable.,"My family and I stayed at the Hudson for three nights. The guest rooms are VERY small. They have one full size, uncomfortable platform bed and a small desk (not large enough to work on). The televisions are mounted on the side wall making watching television in bed difficult. One side of the bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a sheer curtain. The entire bathroom is approximately 3X7ft including the shower area!. Outlets are scarce, so charging a cel phone and a laptop simultaneously is a challenge. On a positive note, the concierges were quite friendly and helpful. The Hudson is definitely for singles and not a family hotel."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 8 2009 ,funky hotel in great location but tiny rooms,"I stayed for just one night - last night in fact! It is in a great location near to Times Square and right by the park. It is very funky and trendy and has a good atmosphere. However, the rooms really are tiny although they have everything that you need in them. My biggest complaint was how noisy - you could not only hear the street but banging and clanking - maybe the heating system all night. I had earplugs but even so, it was very annoying.However, I paid only $100 on Priceline which is fantastic for a good hotel in a good location. I wouldn't choose to stay there again, but if I got it on priceline again I would not be upset."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 6 2009 ,We're too busy to deal with your little problems,"The smallest hotel room I've ever seen, and I've been to London and Tokyo. With a broken phone in the room, I had to go down to the lobby to complain in person (after a long wait) about the faulty TV and heating system -- and the phone, too. They fixed the phone, which later enabled them to put me on hold and/or transfer my call into someone's voice mail for 30 minutes, and when I finally got a human being on the phone he told me they were too busy to deal with the phone or the heating system. Oh -- did I mention the paper-thin walls? If you want to know exactly when your next-door neighbor uses the toilet, this is the place to stay. And did I mention the spectacularly overpriced wine in the bar? And the waitress with big-time attitude?"
Hudson Hotel,Apr 5 2009 ,All hype and rudeness but no substance,"I stayed with my husband at the Hudson while he was in NYC for a business meeting. We were there for 2 nights, and it was the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel. He had to attend a morning meeting so I tried to check into the hotel for both of us. It was 11AM, and they refused to check me in because they said my name wasn't on the reservation (which had been made by his assistant). It was only under his name. I offered to show them my passport as well as his, but they refused. They told me I had to call him, which I tried to do but he was already in meetings and couldn't answer the phone. I asked if they would hold our luggage for the day while I waited for him to return, and they at first said no. After I threw a bit of a fit they finally agreed to hold our luggage, after which I was booted out onto the street to wander around for 5 hours waiting for him to return. Several hours later he was finally able to take a break and call them and &quot;authorize&quot; me on the reservation. I returned to the hotel around 5PM and they finally let me check in, but they gave me no apology. I told the snooty woman at the front desk that I wasn't aware that I needed to bring along my marriage license when I traveled. The room itself was tiny, you had to be a hobbit to use the toilet, and the bed was highly uncomfortable, but the worst part was the banging and clanking mechanical system which would kick in at random times throughout the night, rendering sleep impossible. That combined with the high rates, snobby and unhelpful staff, over priced everything and skimpy services ranks this hotel as the worst I have ever experienced. I wouldn't stay here again if it was the last hotel in NYC."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 1 2009 ,Great Value at $225 or less,"This contemporary hotel has everything you need. While the rooms are tiny, they are notable for their efficient use of space and luxurious touches. The public spaces of the hotel are plentiful, and well equipped for doing business. Unlike many bargain hotels in New York, this one looks nice, has great linens and is a pleasure to come back to.One nit would be the wait staff at breakfast: exceeding amounts of attitude. You would think that rather than (failing to) serving you coffee, they were tending the rope at a swanky club.All-in-all, a great value."
Hudson Hotel,Apr 1 2009 ,Good value in a great location,"This hotel is a fantastic option for those looking to do New York on a fairly tight budget, but who are not willing to 'rough it' in a youth hostel, or chance it in a less reputable hotel.The only con is that the rooms are small. However, my boyfriend and I stayed four nights and we were comfortable enough. There isn't any room to unpack really, only minimal storage, so for longer stays I wouldn't recommend it, but for short stays its great. The rooms themselves are nicely done out, and very clean. They were also very quiet, despite parties being downstairs at the bar at all hours.The location couldn't be faulted at all. Minutes from several subway stations, a walk to central park, and not far from midtown. We managed to walk nearly everywhere. The hotel is also very trendy. The various bars, and the fact that the hotel is popular lone for these, stops this feeling like a cheap hotel and make it feel far more expensive than it really was! The service was excellent also and helped maintain the trendy feel. I would reccomend this hotel to all couples - young or old, and families (provided you get a bigger room!) But i'd be careful if your planning on a long stay, or are planning on sharing a room with someone other than a significant other as they really are cosy!"
Hudson Hotel,Mar 30 2009 ,Frustrating.,"I really wanted to like this hotel - it is delightfully bizarre. The staff was at times very helpful; at others, not so much (like when I was trying to change a $100, and the lone front desk clerk didn't have access to the cash drawer!). The bars are quirky and fun, though sometimes off-limits due to private parties; but if you do get in, there may not be anywhere to sit. Everything but the room was expensive - the breakfast buffet costs twice what it rightfully should have. The room was about 1/3 the cost of a typical midtown room (via Hotwire) - but 1/4 the size. Internet access just didn't work. The heat was unnecessarily on at full blast in the hallways, which meant I had to have the A/C on in the room. Unfortunately, the HVAC unit is smack up against the head of the bed, and it's a compressor-based system; when it kicked on periodically during the night, it would jar me awake. The hotel cries out for a bit of management to better channel the efforts of the well-intentioned staff. As it stands, I would recommend it only for young people substantially more interested in a good time at a low cost than sleep or comfort.At &quot;regular&quot; prices - like some of those I've seen quoted here (over $300???) - forget it."
Hudson Hotel,Mar 29 2009 ,Great bar - shame about the rooms!,"The bar in the Hudson is fantastic - really lively and a bit of a hot spot - I loved it but had one gripe which was that there was one night where we, even as guests in the hotel, really struggled to get in to the bar as we were not apparently on a list. Considering that a hotel should be a home from home whether you are on holiday or business I thought this was pretty poor service. Thankfully we were eventually let in but we then had to come out to speak to the bouncers so that a friend who was meeting us was allowed in. Madness - what is the point of having a bar in a hotel if you are not allowed to use it? (For any SATC fans I think its the same bar where Samantha ditches Smith and disappears upstairs with Richard.....) The rooms are tiny and there is just about enough room to walk around the outside of the bed - so if you are planning to do any shopping there isn't going to be a lot of room to store it in - be warned. I have stayed in other hotels in NY and you don't get much square footage for your money - but these rooms are ridiculous. If you just need somewhere where you can collapse on to the bed as soon as you open the door this is the hotel for you!The bathrooms are really small - unless you are a size zero you are going to struggle to turn around and just so that you know - if you are staying in the same room as a friend or anyone other than a partner - they will be able to see you having a shower thanks to the glass walled bathroom.... ok if you don't mind showing your bits off but not for the shrinking violets among us! The gym is tiny as well in keeping with the theme of the hotel rooms - I wouldn't bother - just take your trainers and go for a run in the park instead.Breakfast is good - served in a darkened room so if you have been up all night enjoying the bar no one should notice! I WOULD recommend it to a friend as its clean, a great location and a lively bar but if you want space try somewhere else."
Hudson Hotel,Mar 28 2009 ,Excellent location! Trendy designet Hotel!,"From a design point of view it is excellent hotel!!! Worth visiting just to admire the interior design! Rooms are tiny but comfortable, my boyfriend ans I were staying there for a week and it was fine. You are in NY so you will spend the least time in hotel. The hotel bar/club is very busy on saturday/friday. People from all over the city come there to have fun. I do recommend to check it out! Overall, very good experience, will definitely come back!"
Hudson Hotel,Mar 26 2009 ,Pretentious and tiny rooms,"This hotel is very pretentious and the standard room is tiny! They managed to fit everything in quite cleverly (including room for our suitcases), but if you are not of average build you could have trouble moving around. It was a nice room as they go but there was no free wifi or breakfast so I felt value was low."
Hudson Hotel,Mar 25 2009 ,Unusual hotel with staff that go the extra mile.,"We stayed overnight at the hudson on the way home from Hawaii. We were met by Mike at the door who gave us a lovely welcome and straight away organised our bags to be taken to the room, which was nice as we had arrived quite late in the evening and were quite tired. Upon entering the hotel up the lime green escalator I thought maybe I had made a mistake I was wrong. Upon entering reception our check in was dealt with by very friendly staff who offered a complimentary upgrade and we were in our room within minutes. Yes the room was smaller than some we had stayed in so maybe a standard room is very small. But the room was well equiped and clean with a comfy bed for our overnight stay. We quickly popped down to the restaurant to eat and both had a lovely meal cooked by the Chefs in the open kitchen. We didn't realise when booking it was St. Patricks day the next morning. We asked if we could store our bags as check iout normally 12.00, reception advised we could leave bags in our room until about 1.30 and to go and enjoy St. Patricks day parade this was really helpful and gave us a little more time to walk the 2 blocks down to 5th avenue to watch the parade which was just amazing. (if you are planning a trip to NY at this time of year try and be there for March 17th) Upon check out I got in the 'slow' queue, but it was noticed that I had been waiting longer than some and moved along which I thought was really nice. The hudson is not your normal Hilton/Hyatt etc. as it is a very individual hotel but the staff we encountered were so friendly helpful. Would we stay there again?? Most definalely yes, although we are in our 50's and feel it probably is more suited to 30/40 age group."
Hudson Hotel,Mar 24 2009 ,Tiny but convenient,"We stayed on night at the Hudson hotel and though the room was tiny, the location was ideal for a great trip. The room has not been cleaned properly for a while, since it was a bit dusty and the representative were ok, but the service was coldly courteous as opposed to enthousiast. I would probably return if I had to."
Hudson Hotel,Mar 22 2009 ,Trendy hotel in a great location,"I lived in NYC for almost twenty years and usually stay at the Washington Square Hotel in Greenwich Village. I booked the Hudson because we found a fantistic rate of $149 a night over the frigid MLK weekend in January. I'd been to the hotel for drinks before, and knew that it was a bit of a scene, but as a hotel, it definitely did not disappoint. When we arrived, the staff was extremely pleasant, and we were actually upgraded. So the room, while not huge, was much larger than the one we'd booked. The room was hip and modern in terms of design, but some might find the heating to be noisy. Having lived in NY, I am familiar with noisy water heat in old buildings, but if you are not, you will likely find it to be noisy. Again, for $149, this hotel was a steal; at $350 a night, we may have found it to be too much. When you return at night, the lobby will have turned into a loud nightclub, due to the two popular lobby bars. You either like that or you don't, but our room was on a high floor and there was no problem with noise from the lobby at all. We had drinks at the Library Bar, which were expensive, but no more so than other hotels in NYC. Also, it would be great if they offered free wireless; it is $10 per night. But, in terms of location, it is right off of Columbus Circle and Central Park. While I never lived in that neighborhood, it is a very pleasant, central place to stay for a long weekend. I would happily return."
Hudson Hotel,Mar 21 2009 ,It's Not As Bad As The Rest of the Reviews Here Suggest,"My wife and I decided to take a short break in New York, first time away from the kids so we wanted to make sure we had a good time of it. Booked this hotel using Priceline's &quot;name your price&quot; and got the room for $110 (+fees) per night which we were happy with... that was until we started reading reviews panning this place into oblivion. We expected the worst and we pleasantly surprised to find it not to be that bad at all.Yes it is dark inside but so what... if you wear sunglasses inside, you're an idiot, if you don't wear sunglasses inside, you're fine!Yes it is pricey to grab a drink in the bar or eat... so eat out, it's not like there's not much choice.Yes the staff are young (and restless?) but we found everyone to be really friendly and helpful from the doormen to the concierge to the checkin staff to the checkout staff... even the maid's seemed really friendly always saying &quot;Hi&quot; as you passed them, although we didn't really stop to chat.Yes the rooms are tiny but unless you're grossly overweight or plan on spending all your time in New York pining away in your room (in which case there really is no help for you!)... the rooms are perfectly fine.Yes the beds are low... erm... I'm not sure what the problem is... if you can't get out of a bed that is a little lower to the ground than the average bed, you probably shouldn't be travelling unaccompanied!The GoodThe exceptionally small rooms are surprisingly well laid out and had lots of nice little touches that either made them seem larger or added to the overall usability of the room. E.g. ipod dock with speakers, mirrored walls (nudge, nudge, wink, wink), LCD TV built into the mirrored wall, window to the bathroom from the bedroom (allows for lots of light to get in and makes both rooms feel airier (is that a word?).The rooms are very cleanThe room has controllable and responsive heating systemNice little nook for a closet, big enough to fit a medium suitcase, opened on the fold out standThe hotel is modern and pretty classyBathroom is stocked with fancy shampoos and soaps (not that I used any of it)Location is great, a 15 minute walk from Times Square, a 3 minute walk from Central ParkThe BadNo getting away from it the rooms are small but they are still functional and comfortable for a short visitThe windows are not really sound proof... we were on the 14th Floor and by 6:30am the hustle and bustle outside were clearly audible (but then again, if I was asleep I probably wouldn't have noticed... I'm an early riser)The HVAC is noisy, every time it kicks in it seems like every component inside the unit behind the headboard jumps 2 inches to the right and flaps open randomly (RECOMMEND - turn the heating down so it doesn't come on as often)The mini bar was extortionately priced... $4.50 for a small bottle of water... luckily there are plenty of shops close by so stock up on food and drink from the outside if you think you might be tempted to eat/drink in the roomHigh Speed wireless internet available for $10 a day... why do hotels insist on charging for this still? It should be a freebie.Although pleasant, the concierge was misinformed on a couple of things... e.g. we wanted to purchase a New York Pass (gets you access to tons of attractions including all the main ones) for a low price (we paid $99 for 2 days and definitely got our money's worth), however, we asked the concierge if we could buy one at the Circle Line Cruise place (Pier 83) and we were told no and that the best place to get them was in Times Square... consequently we didn't have time to get to Times Square, grab tickets and get to Pier 83 for a 10am cruise... turns out that a) the place in Times Square was not a main office and only had 1 ticket left for sale b) we walked past a main office (Gray Line office 47th and 8th) on the way to Times Square only to have to walk back c) we could have bought the tickets from Pier 83 and thus made the 10am cruise after all!!!The UglyNo show stoppers... all the bad stuff (above) are minor inconveniences but nothing that would make me not want to stay here... that said, if you're married to a big fat lass or a big fat lad, the mirrored walls and window from the main room into the shower could be a little off putting... luckily the window has a curtain on both sides so you can close them to protect your eyes and as for the mirrored walls, you can either close your eyes or turn the light off... or just be happy with the person your with and enjoy the ride (if you excuse the pun!)Would be more than happy to stay there again should Priceline push me in that general direction."
Hudson Hotel,Mar 21 2009 ,Tiny but reliable,"Swinging a cat would be a major challenge (well, impossible really) in a standard room at the Hudson, but we always stay there when we're working in New York because it's fun and buzzy, if a bit daft. The food is lovely, the staff are great and the concierges are very good indeed. The hot water in the showers has let me down on more than one occasion. New York hotels are tricky; here you know what you're getting."
Hudson Hotel,Mar 18 2009 ,Not as bad as I expected,"I had read all the other reviwes and thought I had booked a real dud through hotwire. The price we paid ($108.00+tax) was well worth the location and a clean place to rest our head. The rate above only came with one room, to upgrade to two beds would have been an additional $120. We could have gotten another room cheaper than that. The decor is funky, but cool."
Hudson Hotel,Mar 17 2009 ,Cool but very very small,There are much better hotels in NYC than the Hudson. The place is a complete fire trap and terribly dark and black. Get out of there and get a decent hotel.
Hudson Hotel,Mar 13 2009 ,Scary Spookhouse Ride,"The Hudson is less of a hotel than a dark, rough fun house ride by design impostor Philipe Starck. A flickering two-foot high gas torch marks the entrance. Its flames crack the surrounding concrete of the Soviet-style mausoleum façade. Walk sideways in front of the glass to enter - it confuses everyone - and ascend the shoulder-wide three-story escalator to a green-lit low beam lobby entrance. The lobby is practically unlighted and paneled in faux dark wood. The pleasant tee-shirted staff have an attitude of corporate-enforced peppiness. They know you'll be calling about the 15,000 decibels of pulsating bass that makes its way up through the ventilation to your room several floors above. Lurch into the small crowded elevator and hope you can find the right button before you pass your floor. If you manage to see the button in dark, it may be partly covered by the textured wood paneling. As you creep down the narrow charcoal-painted hallways, your back crimps with anticipation at what lies beyond the door to your room. Your animal instincts serve you well. It is not a room - it is a paneled cell, sheathed in more of the same dark fake wood paneling. Do not drop any small valuables. You will not find them again in the dark corners. As everywhere else in the Hudson, the ornamental lighting actually impairs vision. Mr. Starck, a maker of bath faucets and blow molded plastic goods, has managed to backtrack on ninety years of progress in lighting design since Poul Henningsen developed efficient, soft illumination; Starck's weird ornamental fixtures manage to provide glare without illumination. And watch out in the bathroom! because the toilet is only 16 inches from the wall. If you don't bang your shins on your way into the kinky glass shower (please don't ask), you'll smack your head into the tiles when you sit on the pot. Owww. Better slide to the bottom of the bed than getting out on the right side because the wall-mounted TV is waiting to separate your shoulder.Now for that 1:30 AM call to the front desk to get them to turn down the Pink Floyd in concert in the bar. The operator says &quot;no problem&quot;, the hotel manager will speak to the bar manager. Nodding off 25 minutes later in spite of the noise, the hotel security desk calls to inquire about my complaint. Another five minutes later, the front desk calls back to inquire whether the noise level is better. Now it's two in the morning. Is this punishment for the noise complaint? Thanks for the calls. When I speak to the desk manager in person the following day, I am told, between enthusiastic handshakes, that there is no substitute room available for me and that the hotel had vacated the fourth floor as a buffer floor but he would speak to the bar manager… What kind of Hotel keeps its guests awake with loud night club music?!The poor staff - probably artists, writers, grad students, actors - ask timidly &quot;have you enjoyed your stay&quot; and start to apologize before the answer comes. The rooms are not merely small. They are walk-in closets. The whole place is dark and unbearably loud. All very exhausting. Of course you should not stay here. If you think I'm kidding here, go see for yourself some evening and ask to a see a room."
Hudson Hotel,Mar 9 2009 ,Great Hotel,"We stayed here in August/Sept 2009 and had read all the reviews. We were worried about the noise and the staff. We had a great time, our room was ting but we expected that and it was super clean and modern, the staff were friendly and helpful. We had no noise in our room at all. The Hudson is a great bouitque hotel and is close to everything, we walked everywhere!"
Hudson Hotel,Mar 4 2009 ,Great atmosphere and tiny rooms!,"The room was just a bed and to get into the shower/toilet, one had to literally squeeze self! After an an exhaustive day, a late check-in 2145hours with an equally early check-out the following day, i just collapsed into bed. Its an expensive hotel with no frills at US$460 bed only that is steep! A noisy place with the subway but again that is New York! Would look elsewhere for cheaper and less hot spots in future. Otherwise desk agent was great, put an anticipated long distance phone call through dispite challenges in pronoucing my name!"
Hudson Hotel,Mar 3 2009 ,Tucked Away Trendy Tiny,"This would be my 2nd time to stay in the Hudson New York. I picked it again because of it's location, trendiness and at the time of my stay, the price. My room for my 1 night stay was $279, which included 2 beds and a larger bathroom. It's lounge/club downstairs on the lobby level was a ton of fun on a Friday night, great crowd and super music mix. Oh, and the breakfast room service was out of this world! We ordered 4 different things between the 4 of us and it was a superb!"
Hudson Hotel,Feb 28 2009 ,Beat Up Tired ,"I really want to like this hotel. Still &quot;edgy&quot; and &quot;hip&quot; lobby with friendly staff, but the standard rooms are really worn and need some help. Yes they are really small like a cruise ship and designed for Euros or small people, but are in bad need of refurbishment. Mattress was beat and think it gave us both a rash from bed bugs. Door way and bathrooms need attention. Mirror was cracked. Hallways had musty smell as well as cigarette smoke despite &quot;no smoking&quot; floor. Really bad experience. Needs a tummy tuck and face lift. The hotel needs to have some re-newed energy back."
Hudson Hotel,Feb 26 2009 ,Fabulous hotel and perfect location,I recently stayed at the Hudson Hotel with my best friend. We were in New York for 5 days of shopping and sight seeing. We were a little bit concerned about the hotel because we had read in reviews that the rooms were tiny and it was very dark everywhere.When we arrived the staff were very friendly and our room was lovely...yes it was small but believe me for the amount of time you spend in it it was perfect. The location was amazing with a subway station at the end of the street and Times Square only a few blocks or a short subway ride away. It was dark inside but it was all part of the ambience of the hotel.We didn't eat in the restaurant because there are so many other places to eat but we did use the bar. On Saturday night it turns into a nightclub with a great atmoshere and people even come in from the street to have a drink and party because it's so nice. Overall I would highly recommend the Hudson hotel for a city break.
Hudson Hotel,Feb 25 2009 ,We liked it,"So the rooms are about as small as a room can be, so be prepared for it like we were and you won't be disappointed! The bed was pretty small, but the linens were good enough. Room and shower room (no bath) were spotlessly clean. Lots of noise from the street, but you are in New York! Service: We had one incident where the maid took a white top from our room by accident, but we never got it back and this wasn't followed up and the staff didn't seem to care. We went out on the roof terrace and we waited about 20mins to get served (it was a nice wait, though!)The feel of the hotel is very unique - very dark all over (although the room was very light and bright). A nice, funky, trendy, fresh feeling.Location is great, right near the subway and right near central park."
Hudson Hotel,Feb 25 2009 ,Great locationnice rooms shitty bathroom,"Next to central park, within walking distance of time square, and almost everything but the village, great locationLobby and hallways hip, stylish, not terribly well lit and warm, but that goes with Starck territory.Room for 4 plenty big enough, elegant and clean.AC incredibly loud (at least you can't hear the noise in the street).Bathroom : no pressure in shower faucet, and bathtub clogged with hair. Yuck!"
Hudson Hotel,Feb 22 2009 ,Hip and happening but no substance,Arriving at this place we really didn't think it was a hotel - it is a most bizarre entrance with an escalator up to reception. This is touted as the place to see and be seen - which I'm sure it is...it's just very expensive for the smallest of rooms (we paid $469 per night over new year for a room only marginally bigger than the bed!). Having said that the location was fabulous and the bar was impressive. When we go back we will probably stay somewhere cheaper and less pretentious
Hudson Hotel,Feb 19 2009 ,totally cool experience,"My wife and I came to new york for my 50th birthday,and thanks to my wife choosing to stay at the Hudson,it made the trip a memorable experience.Immediately when entering the building you notice how unusual and cool the place is,and how reports of it being dark and moody are quite true but not disturbing.The music/furniture/fittings/bare brickwork/ wooden floors really blend together to create a relaxed feel to the place. Without any hesitation, the staff,all young and extremely courteous,checked us in and we were allocated our room.After having a cocktail in the library room first (awesome)we went to our room (queenstandard)which was compact but really nice.3 nights later though,due to a slight problem with the heating in the room we asked for another room and were upgraded to a deluxe studio on the 23rd flr which was superb,if you can get into one of these or higher, the views are great with more space to move about.Room service was quick and efficient, both supper and breakfast were very good.The restaurant again had a creative menu and was very busy during our stay.All in all we would have no hesitation coming back to the Hudson again when in New York."
Hudson Hotel,Feb 18 2009 ,Modern Hotel,"When you first see the hotel from the outside it looks nothing special, with the flames burning at night on the weekends. But go up the yellow lighted escalators to reception and be prepared to be amazed at the design. A picture is attached to my review, but be aware that the corridors are just a dimly lit.Free vend pool table, which is great to pass away an hour.As other travelers stated, the basic rooms are small. You can just move around the room. I had booked three rooms of which the last was upgraded and more than twice as big. Excellent location, just 5 mins walk from Central Park. My only issues were the room safe was not attached to anything, so I could have locked something away, but the burglar could have walked off with the safe!!! I explained this to reception, but in the usual process driven way there was nothing they could do unless I was in the room, how stupid!! Anyway, as I had multiple rooms we just used the safe in another room."
Hudson Hotel,Feb 17 2009 ,Too hip for me,"One wonders if Phillipe Starck watched a Tim Burton film festival before designing the public spaces of this hotel. They are striking to look at -- but very, very dark. Hallways are cave-like. Lighting in the front reception area resembles that inside a movie theatre while the feature is showing. Good luck trying to read -- or even to see the face of your companions -- while seated in the lobby, Unlike other reviewers, I was not shocked by the small size of our room -- dimensions are accurately portrayed on the firm's website, and I've stayed in smaller rooms in Europe. The room was clean, stylish, and (somewhat surprisingly) quiet. But it was very snug, and not configured in a way to make computer work or even reading practical, unless one were to do it on the bed. Style often trumps rather than facilitates function here.The hotel is probably ideal for party-hearty 20 somethings, who will enjoy the throbbing hip-hop music that plays in the elevators at night, but older people who enjoy light and space are better off elsewhere."
Hudson Hotel,Feb 15 2009 ,Location is great yes the rooms are small but it's NY,"Like other reviewers I agree the rooms were small, but we knew that having read the trip advisor reviews.Along with small rooms, there were a couple of other things that could have improved our stay. The down escalotor to street level was broken, and it wasn't that clear how to get out... other than use the lift.Gym equipment was broken and there are no toilets on the gym level.Breakfast is expensive for the choice/range you get. What you can't fault is the location. First timers to NY we loved the location of this hotel, as we walked to so many things and found the area safe and easy to get to.Although the room was small it was comfortable, very clean, quiet and the toiletries of good quality. Besides we weren't in our room other than to sleep.They also make very good use of the small space and what they manage to get in. Although I suggest you pull both the curtains in the bathroom, so you can't see in from the bedroom!But not so sure about the nightclub in the area off reception that is pumping on a Monday night.!"
Hudson Hotel,Feb 4 2009 ,Cave Coffin Jail Cell Dark Loud Terrible Burn Your Money instead!,"Think Shawshank Redemption on a bad day. Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to lie in a closed coffin? Or to spend time in a cave or bunker? Another way to describe the hotel rooms here would be to say that this is what it must feel like to be thrown into the trunk of a Yugo and stay there over night. AVOID this place at all costs! Be aware that I am describing the room that is one step above the standard. I shudder at the thought of what the basic room might be like. Run far, far away from it. This hotel used to b a Fordham University dorm, and they have the audacity to charge upwards of $180 for a terribly uncomfortable stay inside of a drawer. This was the pits. The breakfast was also an insult at $27+. Stay away! I would have had more fun burning my money."
Hudson Hotel,Feb 2 2009,Tiny rooms with very poor air con,"We stayed at the Hudson in January and were very disappointed. as regular visitors to NY we were expecting good things from this hotel and frankly we didn't see anything good. The rooms are tiny and I mean tiny. Yes, you wouldnt want to spend a lot of time in a hotel room in NYC but we did expect to be able to move freely around the room. The bathroom was dreadful and your knees touched the wall when you sat on the toilet (and I am very short - 5ft 2). Every night we were kept awake by the antiquated plumbing and air con system which clanked all night. The heating came on at random times and left the room boiling hot. I really couldnt think of anything nice to say about this hotel."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 31 2009 ,a chic youth hostel,"This hotel combines a lot of extremes: perhaps the coolest atmosphere for a hotel; the worst front desk service; the most insulting bar markup ($9 Corona beers); the smallest rooms (literally your queen size futon takes up all of the floor space); a wonderful patio and quiet private feeling interior; some of the cheapest rooms in NYC; some of the noisiest out-of-date steam heaters. Choose your poison. If you like design, I'd do it. If you like service and marble bathrooms absolutely stay away."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 29 2009 ,Falling Apart,"The poor Hudson Hotel is in need of some refurbishment - it is falling apart.I have just spent four terrible nights in the Hudson Hotel. First night -window broken - freezing cold. Second night, new room, air con would not turn off - baking hot at 5am maintenance came and turned it off. Third night air con would not turn on -8C outside no heat inside, maintenance came to turn it on. Fourth night no hot water, showered in cold water (as did my colleague with her room on a different floor) and checked out. It is rightly placed in Hell's Kitchen it was hell. The staff were lovely, the hotel is bad."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 28 2009 ,Loved the Hudson despite the teeny tiny room,"Yes, the rooms are teeny tiny. I would not recommend a standard room for more than one person. However the rooms do make excellent use of the space, the bathroom is well designed, and there is space to hang clothes and store luggage. My only problem with the miniature room was the miniature TV - I would have liked a larger flatscreen TV.I asked for a room on one of the top floors, and as such it got lots of natural light which probably made it a bit more comfortable. My room also had a 'glimpse' of the Hudson River from the window, which was nice. The lobby is spectatcular, and the breakfast included in my room rate was delicious. The lobby bar was a great place for a drink, although typically pricey. The Library was also a great space to relax if you feel a little too claustraphobic in the room, and I was even able to eavesdrop in on a few celebrity interviews taking place there during my stay.Location was excellent, close to the subway and Central Park. The Whole Foods just across the street at Columbus Circle is great for picking up fresh food.The front desk staff were a little disorganised at times, and I occasionally had to wait a while for some things ie my breakfast vouchers. But all in all I would definitely consider staying at the Hudson again if a good rate was on offer."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 24 2009 ,Nice stay but small room...,I stayed in the Hudson Hotel in December for Christmas shopping in New York.I had a nice stay. The food in the restaurant was very delicious. They have a cosy library where we enjoyed a cup of coffee.The room was very small but decorated in a nice way.The service at the reception was not so good.
Hudson Hotel,Jan 23 2009 ,Ok....not very impressed,"We stayed for 6 nights in January on our honeymoon. When we first got there it seemed quite cool although my husband said it reminded him of some hostels he had stayed in in South America. Check in was ok but our room was not ready until after 4pm. We supposedly got an upgrade to a superior room, although it was so tiny I don't know how any room could be smaller than that. But it looked ok, if a bit weird. The beds are low and not that big, but adequate. Then the problems started: firstly, the heating didnt work unless you turned it up to 90 degrees, and then it was too hot! It also made a terrible banging noise all night, so I had to wear earplugs. Also, the water never got that hot unless you showered first thing in the morning. And the worst thing was the toilet was not stuck down to the floor, so it banged back down every time you stood up!The corridors are really dark and overheated, its all a bit weird. I think this place focuses too much on its bar and not enough on the guests who are paying to stay there. The staff are helpful if you ask for it. I wouldn't stay here again."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 21 2009 ,Small Rooms,"Booked this hotel on Expedia cheap rates for NY. The lobby and bar are great, the restaurant had fabulous food. The rooms however are really small, I felt like I was on a cruise ship in one of those cabin rooms. The desk was something my 6 year old nephew would sit at. Not a great hotel if you are looking to be productive on business. I could see this hotel as a place to crash when you are drunk and just need a place to lay your head down."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 21 2009 ,Loved the Hudson great place to stay in NY!,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Hudson in January and we both found it to be a great hotel. We had read several reviews referring to small cramped rooms and unfriendly staff, but found this simply not to be the case.Yes the rooms are small but how much time are you spending in your hotel room while in New york?!! We upgraded the room to a superior and had more than enough room to put our luggage and shopping. I am over 6ft and didn't find the rooms to be that much trouble. The coridoors are dark, but consistent with the rest of the hotel and we did not find them 'dangerous' or 'ridiculous' as previous people have referred to them as.As for the staff, checking in and out was seamless and they were more than happy to help us out at any time, even booking us restaurant reservations and giving out some valuable tourist information.If you're looking for a cool hotel located right next to the park and within easy reach of Times Square and 5th Avenue, then this is the place. The older generation might struggle to get to grips with the low lights and funky bars, but then again, it wasn't designed for the over 50's... no offence!!All in all, its a great place to spend a few days in NYC, while the bars and restaurants in the hotel may be pricey as you'd probably expect it to be ($9 for a bottle of Corona....hmmmmm!!) Its just as easy to pick out some nice restaurants and bars locally and breakfast round the corner in Flames was a great place to go in the mornings.Recommended for young couples and groups of mates looking for a bit of a treat of a stay in a great city."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 19 2009 ,Underwhelming Hotel,"Whenever I go to NYC I try to stay at a different hotel. And there is something I like about Morgan's Hotel Group hotels. My impressions usually run from OK to great. But I found the Hudson underwhelming.As with many Morgan's the lobby is a kick. It has the feel of a brick warehouse, with ivy growing all over the ceiling. It's dark, but that's typical. There is loud music playing all day and night. Having a greeter was a nice touch, though she didn't do much but say hello and welcome.Front desk staff was really pleasant and helpful. My room was about the size of a decent walk-in closet. I could barely move around the bed, the workspace just held my laptop. And the dark paneling made it feel even smaller.The bathroom was proportionately small. I could barely move around in it. The water never really got hot, the sink never really shut off. The only nice feature was a big window between the shower and the room so I could watch ESPN while getting clean. The dining space is intersting - same brick as the lobby with long community tables. The food was so-so, and definitely not worth the $30 I paid for the buffet. I was impressed with their gym, which had 3 treadmills and other cardio equipment each with their own TV, and plenty of weight equipment. And it was a big space so it never felt crowded.Location is fine, about 2 blocks from Columbus Circle. And you can't really beat the low room price. But there are much better hotels in NYC, and certainly better Morgan's hotels."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 19 2009,WOW! would go back tomorrow,"I was a bit worried at first knowing that the rooms were quite small, but when i got there they were bigger than i thought! All you need room for is to sleep, store your clothes and to have a shower. The bathroom was a good size and so was the bedroom for that matter, plenty of room. The shower was great! Lovely compfy bed with clean fresh sheets daily and a big flat screen tv etc. The staff and hotel was first class. We were given breakfast vouchers which came in really handy. The location could not have been better, on one side was central park and the other time square. The Hudson bar was fantastic, very busy and popular with a great atmostphere. Very very stylish! Although it was freezing in NYC that time of year, we were lovely and warm in the hotel. We will be going back to the hudson hotel in the summer for sure next time to experience the amazing sky terrace.Thank you all at the hudson hotel for a great stay."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 16 2009 ,small rooms great location,"The reviews of Hudson Hotel you find on Tripavisor are basically correct: rooms are small, hotel design is not such a big thing, good location (expecially if you ride the Subway) is absolutely the &quot;plus&quot;.My wife and I needed a clean double room and Hudson satisfied our request. We hoped the rooms were bigger than it seemed from the user pictures... and they were not! (actually New York hotel rooms aren't quite &quot;large&quot;, Hudson was in average, after all).The hotel designer is Philip Starck and his best things are the bar and the lobby (not the rooms). If you like &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; you'll be happy to know that a few scenes were shot at Hudson. Is that enough for their room price? You decide.The staff. They were kind, but somehow they lost our luggage after the check out: we spent 1/2 hour waiting for them to find it. But I still believe it was just a mistake, and mistakes happen. So, don't worry too much about the staff.Three years ago I spent my &quot;New York days&quot; at the Fitzpatricks (on Lexington): it was a smaller hotel, less glossy, and with larger rooms... I liked it more."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 15 2009 ,Now I Know How a Sardine Feels,"My son &amp; I stayed at the Hudson for three nights in early January. The room was booked through Priceline at $115/night + fees. A fairly reasonable rate for a well located NYC hotel. Upon arrival, we did upgrade the room for $90/night in order to have more space and two double beds. The base room is approximately 136 Sq.Ft. with one double bed--very very small. In addition, you must live out of your suitcase because there is no furniture with drawers to store your clothes. These are rooms you will never lounge in--you sleep, bathe &amp; get out. I would never select this hotel if given a choice."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 14 2009 ,Don't be afraid! Stay at the Hudson!,"Got the Hudson for $100 a night via Priceline (hey, it's January in NYC). I came away knowing I'd give them a great review on TripAdvisor because I think the place gets a bum rap here. After reading reviews here I was concerned, but the reviews actually helped me a lot as far as setting expectations goes. Front desk staff were exceedingly friendly and happily checked me in several hours early since my room was ready (yay). No attitude about me having booked through Priceline at all, which was something others have mentioned. I found the lobby and all the public areas VERY groovy and interesting! I did not find the hallways to be shabby or not well-maintained at all, they were just fine. Dark, of course, but not dirty or any of the other stuff folks have mentioned.And yes, the room was extremely small - I believe it was approx 18 feet from the door to the wall behind the bed, slightly less wide - there is maybe a foot of wiggle room on either side of the bed. More than 1 person in the smallest room would be nearly unbearable in my opinion. Somehow I lucked out and had an actual wall between the center of the room and the shower. I didn't find that the shower curtain stuck to me while showering (lol). Nice Korres toiletries too. The bathroom was just the slightest bit...icky, the ceiling and showerhead looked like they could use a little work but for $100 a night I could hardly complain!The bed was super comfy, but was indeed low to the floor. Not an issue for me. Even though I was on the 19th floor I could hear street noise so definitely bring earplugs to ensure a good night's rest. This is par for the course in New York so it really did not bother me. The heating pipes clicked and clacked a little when the heater fired up but again, nothing I couldn't handle and it died down quickly.I did not go to any of the bars/restaurants at the Hudson because the prices are just outrageous. Hang a left out the front door and have breakfast at The Flame Diner on 9th Ave - it's a classic NY diner that ain't fancy, but the food's good and breakfast was less than $10 every day for me! The Belgian waffles are amazing, try one. :-) The coffee is great too. If you're a Starbucks fan, hang a right out the hotel door and it's just steps away.There's also a giant shopping mall inside the CNN building just down the block, on Columbus Circle. All manner of chain stores plus a small Dean &amp; Deluca foods-to-go area and even a Whole Foods in the basement! Subway of course is available at 59th St/Columbus Circle and you're just steps away from Central Park South.Clientele was mostly young Euros using the hotel as a base. They all seemed happy enough to be in such a groovy place. I did see a few bewildered older folks, as in elderly (lol) and a couple of business travelers but overall the crowd skewed young. No probs at checkout, no phantom charges, and they gave me a keypass to use the PC in the business center to print out my boarding pass - just ask nicely and I'm sure you can do the same.All in all, I would stay here again in a heartbeat for $100/night. If I paid $358/night (the going rate) or even $200 a night for the Hudson I'd probably have wanted to die or (kill someone) when I saw the room size and I'd probably pick severely at every aspect of the hotel. If you normally stay in 4-star digs then stay away because you will be disappointed/upset. But for more easygoing peeps with reasonable expectations of a NYC hotel - and who are on a budget, it really can't be beat."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 13 2009 ,We enjoyed the hotel but some words of caution,"Much of what needs to be said about this hotel has been said in other reviews so I will just cover any differentiating factors in my experience and emphasize some main points.I was there is December right before xmas for a little holiday fun. We had two of our three kids with us- two boys one is 13 and the other is a college student at university. I travel on business to NY so I am familiar with the city etc but this was strictly pleasure.Location is a huge plus:The hotel is extremely centrally located which was wonderful for exploring midtown/theater district /5th AVe etc as well as next to the Columbus Circle subway entrace (by which you can go anywhere you want for $2 on the subway. Staff:Staff was extremely courteous, Amy at the front desk went to school at UCSB and we chatted about that. She upgraded our room for a very reasonable fee ( will get to that in a minute). Michael at the door was equally personable. The hotel staff definitely is composed of young hipsters but from check in, to bag storage, to the restaurant/bar, I did not uncover one attitude or any rudeness whatsoever. One front desk clerk was more than happy to hunt down a matchbook for my son who was starting a collection. Room Size:Yes it is very small for a standard room but well configured and well lit. You should note that the standard room comes only with a queen bed. So, if you are two friends planning on sharing a room, or two growing boys etc, this is obviously not ideal. Which brings me to my next point. They upgraded one of our rooms upon request and for $90 to a double deluxe which was very comfortable , I would say even large by NYC standards. My sons stayed in that room with two double beds. We got the room on price line for $150 so even with the upgrade, it was quite reasonable. I would not be happy at all to pay upward of $400 for the standard room. For me, that would not have worked. Otherwise rooms fine, clean, bed comfortable etc. We didnt spend alot of time in our room. If you are there on business, the standard may be too small to actually work and if you are planning on meeting someone there, dont do it in a standard room. NO room whatsoever, the surroundings are intimate. Words of caution/things to note:Hotel lobby is extremely dark, I kid you not about this one. Your eyes literally adjust when you get up the escalator. They are going for some type of atmosphere/ feeling concept etc. So be prepared and if you are not a &quot;young 50&quot; or younger, you may want to rethink this unless you are in the art/design/fashion business, then you will probably get the whole thing, We liked it. I am 42, my husband is 54. Not a problem for us. Our kids were thrilled with the swanky atmosphere. The techno music they play one of the nights in the bar is annoying but that is minor and comes from an outside group that uses the space.Restaurant/Bar-Very pricey. My son had dinner with a friend there and said the food was fine in the &quot;cafeteria&quot; but he thought overpriced, hey this is NY. I went to the library. Again, I loved the space /concept, may not be for everyone. I found it to be warm and inviting but $20 for a glass of wine seemed outrageious, even by NY standards. And they would not let my son in who is 13 which seemed kind of odd given it is not a bar but more a public spot that one can get a drink as well.The area on top was closed and I was disappointed not to see that as I am sure it would be worth a trip up there during the spring/summer.One other note, the heating was up way too high in the hallways near the rooms. It felt like you were in a furnace room but we didnt mention that because we didnt stay in the hotel that long much less in the hallways for any period of time.All in all, it was a very good stay."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 13 2009 ,Great start bad end never go back,"We loved the look of this hotel and knew that the rooms were going to be small after reading reviews, but the area and price were too good to pass up. The hotel is definitely different, but a fun vibe for young people. We had the weirdest and most unprofessional thing happen at the end of our trip though, so we will never go back. Upon looking for the room hairdryer one night and not being able to find it we had to call down for another. It was not until the next morning when I was packing to check out that I found the hairdryer stuffed into nearly the bottom of my suitcase. Our room had been cleaned while we were out the previous day, so I can only assume that the cleaner put it in there. When we told the front desk this, they took all of the information, seemed serious about it and helped us check out. We had to call back 3 times in order to find out what happened (from Canada) and they dismissed us like we were the crazy ones. On top of that, the front desk girl told us, as we were going out sight seeing for the remainder of our day, that after we had checked out that we would not be charged anymore valet time. This was apparently untrue as I received an extra day valet charge for having been in the parking garage during the time the front desk said we could be. They need to get their people straight. If you want to classify yourselves as an upscale hotel, then act like it when customers have issues with some pretty big things. They could not have cared less that one of their staff went through our bags."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 12 2009 ,Small roomsmall bath....,"Got this room thru priceline-it was the best available for the price I was aiming for.Was very surprised about how small this room really was.I have seen reviews of other hotels that Ive stayed and people saying they were small.Well they havent stayed at the Hudson to know what small really is!Bed was near the floor and not much space to put your luggage if there are two people.Didnt like the bathroom because of the glass wall-shower curtain separating the bath from the bedroom.Also when your in the shower the curtains tend to blow inward so less space in the shower.Also the way the sink is designed there is really no wher to put your stuff when getting ready.On the upside nice bath items to use.Loved the soaps!Not to far from Times Square but if your with a senior citizen like I was,we needed to take a taxi back and forth because it was to long or her to walk.The doormen were very quick in getting us Taxi's though.No long wait.The hotel had very good security as on the weekend we were asked to show our keys before getting on the elevator.Lobby was very nice but a little dark as were the halls getting to the room.I would go back to this hotel only if I was by myself or was able to get a larger room.But if you like being in close quarters with someone you wouldnt mind the rooms.Another upside the rooms were kept very clean!"
Hudson Hotel,Jan 12 2009 ,Great Hotel,"Hi,I stayed in the Hudson with my husband for my 30th birthday, 7th of Jan - 11th. On arrival it was exactly the same as the reviews, i.e. the lobby and the lighting, I would however say that the staff were very friendly, we were given our room keys straight away, staying on the 23rd floor. My first impression of the room, was it was slightly, I mean slightly, bigger then expected. The prices of the food, drink and everything else as per previous reviews is way too expensive, which is a pity, but it makes you go outside a lot, an example we bought 2 drinks, 1 cocktail + 1 bottle of beer, total inc tip $27 in the Hudson Bar, and in a very high end Rest, Olive Garden, a big glass of lovely wine was $7 per glass and beers around the same, and the Olive Garden is in the middle of Times Square. The Bed was very comfy, and the room was spotless, the shower head was as per previous reviews a little stained looking and I felt for such an arty hotel, you would expect really high end fittings, but it was fine. The only other problem was the noise of the plumping... every time someone in the room next to you used either the shower or toilet, the pipes made some really weird and loud noises. I think also the senser on the TV is so sensitive that if someone else changes their channel, yours will change also.. ours switched by itself a few times. I would stay there again, because it looked so nice and the location was excellent, and of course a comfy bed, but only if I got a good deal. Loved NYC. Dee"
Hudson Hotel,Jan 11 2009 ,Buyer Beware,"We visited NYC over the Christmas Holiday and booked our hotel through Priceline. Because I had read many online reviews, I was prepared for a VERY SMALL room. The room size met expectations. We bid 170 dollars for the room and with taxes &amp; fees, we paid about 200 a night. Priceline rates this place with 3 and a half stars; shame on Priceline...I expected more with this rating. Upon check-in, we requested a non-smoking room on an upper level. The staff accommodated. We had been warned through reviews that if you are on a lower floor it can be noisy because of the bar below. When we called ahead of time with these requests, we were told that we had to call Priceline...saying that usually you call the hotel directly, but in the case of the Hudson, you call Priceline. Priceline was required to tell us that such requests (a non-smoking room &amp; upper level floor might mean additional charges!!) They did not. When we requested an upgrade to a king size bed at check-in, we were told it would cost an extra 60 dollars a night; we declined. We thought our bed would be a double, but thankfully it was a queen; no extra charge! The bed in this very small room was very low to the floor, presenting a challenge getting out of it. The room safe was level with the floor, requiring that you get down flat on the floor to use it. It was a challenge opening luggage, but I managed to put a couple of decoartive barrels together to serve as a luggage stand. There was a rack for the other bag.Please do not stay here if you expect to sleep at night...the steam pipes creaked and crackled every time the heat came on. I asked if the engineer could check this and was told that the building was SO OLD that it was impossible to stop the noise. The technicians checked it anyway and nothing changed. I solved the problem somewhat, by running the fan continuously so I would not be awakened every time the heat came on. It was very cold in NYC during our stay so the heat came on regularly.There is absolutely no sign outside indicating that you are approaching the Hudson Hotel (we were walking from the subway stop;) you had better know the exact address with exact numbers or you will pass it by. The escalator takes you up to a dark hotel lobby, rather depressing...the hotel room corridors are very dark and narrow and downright dangerous.The bathroom was small but it worked; there were a few small shelves for toilettries. Only once did I have to kill a cockroach crawling in the tub.I was charged for an item from the mini bar which I did not take; I called later when I discovered the charge and the billing office removed it with no argument. It had not appeared on the bill under the door at the morning of chek-out. We had a deposit of 35 dollars per umbrella (we used two) placed on our bill in case we did not return them. We did!The hotel has a great location, near Columbus Circle, subway stations, (we never took a cab...) Starbucks, cafes for breakfast, a large mall, called The Time Warner, (I think.)The concierges were VERY HELPFUL. Thorough, friendly.We would not return to the Hudson Hotel. When friends ask us where we stayed, we are embarrassed to say...by chance, they are familiar with the place!"
Hudson Hotel,Jan 10 2009 ,Darkest hotel with the smallest room ever!,"The Hudson Hotel is supposedly chic, but we found it only to be seriously overpriced for the smallest room we have ever stayed in--too small for two average-sized people to pass by each other. The &quot;ambience&quot; of this hotel may be suitable for ghouls and goths, but definitely not for a 60-ish couple who appreciate light and space. I actually walked into a glass door because of the oppressively dark surroundings! There was literally no public space in the hotel with enough light that I could easily read a newspaper. The only chair in our room was an uncomfortable cold metal one. The room itself was nothing more than a bed with a 15-18&quot; floor space around it. In fact I had difficulty getting out of the foot-high bed without hitting my head on the wall-mounted TV above it. Our experience in the Hudson is enough to convince us not to continue to use Priceline.com. Priceline should not allow the Hudson to pick up bids from middle-aged customers in their &quot;name your own price&quot; deal. We'll not chance being burned again as we were this time. The only redeeming features of the Hudson are location and a friendly young staff, who were unfailingly courteous. Ron, Louisville, KY"
Hudson Hotel,Jan 8 2009 ,great location - good hotel,"i work in a travel agaent so had admired the look of this hotel from afar when i suddently got the chance to go with a friend. ive been to new york before and know the area quite well and this hotel has an excellent location. The taxi found it no problem and when we arrived it was late at night and the the hotel was buzzing with people in and out of the hudson bar. The bar is definately worth the visit, the ceiling pictures are fab and although the drinks are a little on the pricey side they make up for it in the size!!You have colombus underground station almost opposite for the tube around nyc and times square is 15mins walk, 5th avenue 10mins if that.The rooms are on the small side even by ny standards but they are stylish and comfortable for the amount of time you spend in them with flat screen tv and ipod docks, the only thing it lacks is a wardrobe with doors.I would definately recommend this hotel. x"
Hudson Hotel,Jan 7 2009 ,A Mismatch in Design,"I had tickets to the Met so focused on Central Park South using Priceline. The price I got was a very attractive $135/night for me and my wife. I consider myself a fairly sophisticated traveler with worldwide experience. And despite the rate of $135/night I assumed the three star rating would be for an average size room. Wrong! I expect the small size of the rooms should cause the rating to be reduced as my interpretation of a three star rating is for a room much larger than I received. The &quot;mismatch&quot; description refers to the small size of the room but with amenities you might expect from a four star property: paneled walls, way above average (funky) lighting fixtures, bath fixtures way above average for the sink but a single electrical outlet on the wall opposite the sink (if you have a short cord on a razor, hair dryer, etc, make sure you bring an extension cord).What I resent most of all were the packaged &quot;gifts&quot; which, once opened were charged to your room. The small warning that the &quot;gifts&quot; were for sale was easily overlooked. A package of two CD's is one example which I opened before seeing the warning. The price was $30. I complained to the front desk and the charge was removed. The hallways in the hotel are very narrow and the obvious design was to see how many rooms could be carved out of the given space. I would stay here again if the room was used only for the bed. But if I had work to do in the room, it would have been too small to tolerate for more than two days. In fact the desk at the foot of the bed was very small with no convenient electrical outlet for a laptop. This hotel would not be a repeat for me and my wife unless the rate was similarly discounted to other options. The difficulty, of course, is that I used Priceline and could not review the hotel prior to making an evaluation. The hotel’s web site touts this hotel as one of the most luxurious hotels in New York City. This must be a joke."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 4 2009 ,Not My cup of Tea,"My initial thoughts on arrival at the hotel were that although unusual the frontage was strangely atractive but was looking a little tired. This continued on inbto the hotel, the escalators had broken down and the green paintwork was heavily marked and looked somewhat dirty. A short trip in the lift took my wife and I up to a very dark reception with a ceiling covered with ivy and some interesting lighting and impresive chandeliers, on booking in we requested a room upgrade and were given a free upgrade to a deluxe room. A trip up in the lift took us to a dark and dingy looking corridor with strange lighting, the paintwork was tired and the carpets had seen better days. The &quot;upgraded&quot; room way very, very small, to put this in perspective it was without doubt the smallest room I have ever had in a hotel in my travels. The low bed and mirrors were intent on creating the illusion of space but not even this could make the room feel any bigger than a shoe box. In the morning we upgraded the room further to a suite, at a cost of $90 a night. After an interesting breakfast in the &quot;school hall&quot; set out of the breakfast room. We went up to the suit to find a slightly larger room with a slightly larger bathroom, this room was no more than an average sized room and with the extra cost was a very expensive average room. The bags had also not been moved from our other room and after requesting this happen a further 2 times i got the bags myself with my old keycard i had fortunately kept hold of. The best thing about the hotel was the location and a very Funky bar, although the cost of drinks in the bar made this a one visit bar."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 4 2009 ,Fab Hotel Very Funky,"I must say I was very worried when i read the reviews on this site but im pleased to say I had a great time at this hotel.The rooms are small I suppose but not uncomfortable so the staff were great when i spoke to them,which i do admit was not alot I was too busy out having fun.The location is fabulous a 5 minute walk to Central Park and a 15 minute walk to Times square with lots of things to eat and see on the way(Broadway etc).Overall i had a great time and would go back again for sure."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 3 2009 ,Great location but it has its problems...,"This hotel is striking when you walk in and you can tell the people at reception know that!!! The lighting is slightly annoying but makes it look cool so thats fine. The location is really fantastic, you cannot get lost and can easily walk to all the main shopping/eating places (the subway is also across the road). The room was very small but to be honest it didnt bother us as much as other people on here. There were a couple of issues with the bathroom plumbing which were sorted out fairly quickly but the really big issue was the noise - we had to wear ear plugs until around 4am for quite a few nights because of the club downstairs. We ate at the hotel cafeteria one night which has a great feel to it but was not worth the expense when there are so many restaurants in New York (around £130 for 2 courses and 2 drinks!!). Overall, our trip to New York was so great that we put up with some of the issues but we wouldnt stay there again. ps. i have also found out today that they have just added a random charge of about £30 to my bill a few days after we checked out for no apparent reason....apparently they are famous for this."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 2 2009 ,Hudson Hotel - Better than Expected!,"I have traveled to many places and seen many hotel rooms but nothing as unusual as this. This is a good thing since NYC can be hectic, especially around New Years Eve when I stayed. I decided to stay at the hotel at the recommendation of a colleague who used to stay at the Hudson while traveling to NYC. I was not disappointed upon arrival but admit was a tad apprehensive after reading the negative reviews on TripAdvisor.First off, the hotel is on 58th Street just behind the Time Warner Center off Columbus Circle. Columbus Circle's subway stop is convenient to have since it is only a few stops northward from Penn Station or Times Square on the 1, A, or C subway lines However, be on the look out for a fluorescent yellow doorway while walking on 58th Street since the hotel is unmarked. Second, the hotel lobby looks like something of a rainforest complete with wooden furniture and ivy. You will enjoy the bright yellow escalator getting there since it feels like a futuristic voyage. The hotel staff checking in was most accommodating despite the large crowds. I arrived at the hotel early and they got me a room within 30 minutes which was completely understandable given the chaos of New Years. The bellhops were also courteous in asking if I needed help with luggage but I declined since I only had an overnight bag with me. Even the maitre d' offered to help with luggage, something not usually seen. Third, comes the subject of getting to the room and the room itself. Yes, as other reviewers noted, the hallways are a bit dark, but it feels like a crypt in a fun, eerie sort of way. Again, this adds to the ambience. The room is small but it is NYC after all. The lights had a very cool modern design, comfortable furniture, and plush bathroom amenities. It felt like being in a cruise ship room except without being seasick.Fourth, the restaurants are a tad expensive in the Hudson but are worth the money. If you like less expensive options then walk outside the hotel onto 9th Avenue and you will see a Europa Cafe and the Flame Diner. CVS, Starbucks, and a supermarket are on 9th Avenue a half block north of the hotel for convenience. Tip: Buy bottled water at CVS or the supermarket instead of using the one &quot;conveniently&quot; placed in the room.Fifth, the Library and Hudson Bars are great places to have drinks with a good mix of young and old patrons. For a quieter time, check out the Library Bar and cozy up with a book or a game of pool. Note: The Hudson Bar gets VERY crowded around 7:30 P.M. or so.Sixth, checkout was a breeze. The Hudson even offered to store luggage for you for a nominal charge despite checking out while you explore the town and catch some last minute sights. This beats having to lug baggage around.In summary, the Hudson will see a repeat visit from me. The hotel truly felt like a getaway from the grind that is NYC. I did not get to the awesome rooftop lounge since it is closed in the winter but look to revisit in the warmer months. (Extra Tip: Take the C subway line to Fulton Street, then walk 1 block west to Church Street, turn left onto Church and walk about a block south to reach the Century 21 department store downtown. The store has good deals on designer clothes if you know your brands and prices but shop early to avoid the crowds of tourists. Recall that the C subway line stops at Columbus Circle.)"
Hudson Hotel,Jan 2 2009 ,Great Hotel great Location and staff,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Hudson Hotel. Before arriving we were afraid that the rooms would be to small but they were just fine. The room was at the 19th floor with a fantastic view and almost no noise from below.Our bathroom was seperated from the actually room through a door and we had enough space for three big bags.A plus was the flatscreen TV.The staff was great too. Fast check in/out, quick reservations and always helpfull.The location of the Hudson is a big plus. 2 min. away from the Central Park, Subway and Colmbus Circle.I would book the Hudson with out a second thougt and can highly recommend it."
Hudson Hotel,Jan 2 2009 ,A bit lost in a great location,"I spent 4 days in NYC for New Year's and booked this hotel at the very last minute through Priceline, for about €230 a night. I had a quick read through Tripadvisor before setting off, and this is probably the most accurately commented hotel of any of those I've stayed in.The location of the hotel is excellent, more or less on Central Park, and only 100m from the Columbus Circle subway, which is on the vital red line. You're never far from anything when staying here.And the unusual style of the hotel is quite nice too. The lobby is very impressive, and the low-lighting throughout does add a certain ambience that you don't normally get in hotels. It does feel like you're in a member's club rather than a hotel. Heating was at full tilt, and seeing as we were in minus temperatures outside, it was always nice to step inside.Check in was very straightforward. The rooms are tiny. If anything over the bare minimum required by a traveller is provided, we're talking about in inches rather than feet. Don't let this put you off though - apart from the lack of a bath, there isn't anything you can't do in one of these rooms that you might do in a suite. So all in all, that's quite good so far, and given the price for the time of year, I really wouldn't complain.Instead, I'd recommend. People staying in the hotel over the week seemed almost all to fall in the economy to mid-range traveller brackets. And I'd imagine that most of these folks took one look at the price list and never spent a single cent on the premises. I risked a bottle of beer one evening and got stung for $9. Which, like everything in the hotel, just isn't worth it.And due to the way the hotel is arranged, it is possible to enter and exit your room without crossing the lobby or encountering a member of staff. So with residents not spending any money, and residents not meeting or even visiting the communal areas, there is no hotel experience here for most guests. It's just a well-positioned, small room in New York.Why a hotel would take this strategy is beyond me. There is a potential four-figure audience for facilities staying each night, but they're all down the road in Starbucks, or another eatery.The premium they're earning on each item is surely dwarfed by the earnings they're losing by outpricing their core audience."
Hudson Hotel,Dec 31 2008 ,Great Location Room Small but hey its NEW YORK!,"When I found out I was staying at this hotel, I knew what I was getting into based on the review here. I was happy that I took a taxi. I'm sure I would still be looking for it, since the hotel has no marquee or sign of any kind. You just have to &quot;know&quot; its there.PRO and CON of the hotel.....Pro: * Great Location... close to the Columbus subway station, a Starbucks, Central Park (and Tavern on the Green!), to the Lincoln Center and a great Whole Foods market!! (The soup at Whole Food sure hit the spot on a cold day, and the price is downright cheap!)* The subway has the route which took us directly to JFK/ AirTrain. * Clean Room, Large bath, Central AC, great Shampoo and soap! (but see the con)* Nice staff. I requested a quiet room, and got what I wanted. The conceirge printed my Delta boarding pass for me... free of charge. Very courteous, dispite the chaos around them.Con:* The interior of the hotel is very dark. Perfect for vampires, but if you want bright and cheery, this is not for you! * Small room: I was in room 1601 which was very basic, and I was glad I packed light. The room had a &quot;closet&quot; with 8 hangers, a double bed, and a fair size bathroom. I think the bathroom was the same size as my sleeping quarter. NO drawers, so I ended up living out of my suitcase. * Thin walls. My neighbor dropped a coin or something metal on his floor and I could have sworn he was in my room!* Not the best lighting in the room. Like the lobby, the light is geared for vampires. If you turn on all the light in the room, it'll get real hot. Lucky you have central AC* Expensive if you eat there... but hey, you're in NYC and there's so much to do outside the hotel. (We found a great Italian place called Manga e Bevi on Ninth Avenue and 53rd Street. Reasonable and FUN!)* Hard to find if you don't know what to look for.Overall I give it 4 out of 5 stars. I'd stay there again if it were just me and my spouse. New York has so much to see and do, why bother staying in side the hotel?? The price on hotwire was decent and I stayed there during Christmas. No real complaints here!"
Hudson Hotel,Dec 29 2008 ,Bring a Sense of Humor,"Read the reviews. All true. The good: Great location right at Lincoln Center. Asked for and was cheerfully given an upgrade. Had a king room with two windows. Lobby has hip vibe. The not-so-good: Our upgraded room had about 2 feet on either side of the bed and about 1 foot to clear the end of the bed. Can't imagine what the original room looked like. I'm 5' tall and my knees touched the wall when using the loo. Absolutely no room for anything. You better be very good friends with your roommate as you can lay in bed and watch them showering and doing all their bathroom chores through the glass wall and sheer curtain. Halls are dark and not as clean as they ought to be. And yes, it's noisy and drafty. Priceline lists this as a 3-1/2 star hotel. I'd give it 2 stars. You can do better."
Hudson Hotel,Dec 28 2008 ,Liar Liar pants on fire!!!,"We booked our room at the Hudson Hotel using Priceline and were able to get a really big discount off of the price posted on their website. The lobby was very hip, however, a little on the dark side. Our room was adequate, although as mentioned by previous reviewers, a little on the small side. We did have room to put a suitcase on each side of the bed and still had room to move around. Overall, our stay was enjoyable, until check-out. On the morning of our departure, we found a bill under our door outlining incidental charges for our stay. As we had pre-paid with Priceline, we were not expecting any additional charges. We were very surprised to find that we had been billed for 3 pay-per-view movies @ 18.95 each and an item from the mini-bar @ 7.50. We did not watch any movies or take anything from the mini-bar. The staff at the front desk was not helpful at all and said that their system was accurate and that we would have to pay those charges. We asked to speak to a manager and were told that the manager would tell us the same thing. We were rather surprised that they would be so inflexible in dealing with our problem. The manager did finally come over to assist with our problem. We asked which movies we had supposedly watched and what time we had watched them. We also asked what item we supposedly had taken from the mini-bar. We offered to present them with receipts from restaurants, ticket stubs from shows, and subway receipts as proof that we were not in our room very much during our stay. We were told that they had no way of pulling up movie titles or times, only that we had watched 3 movies. The manager did finally agree to remove 2 of the movie charges and the mini-bar item, but still insisted on charging us for the third movie. What horrible customer service!!! He acted like he was doing us a huge favor by removing the charges. Instead, it was obvious that he didn't believe us. I have had incorrect charges on hotel bills in the past, but in all of my other experiences the charges were removed without question. Needless to say, this experience completely ruined our impression of this hotel. While I would have been quick to recommend the Hudson Hotel prior to check-out, I would never go back after basically being called a liar!"
Hudson Hotel,Dec 27 2008 ,The best funky hotel I ever stayed,"I already read a lot of bad stuff about this hotel, but I stayed there on thanksgiving week and I loved!!!! One of the best funky hotel that I ever stay. I'm architect and I agree that the rooms are small, but why do you want a big room with you are in NYC?!?! Go out!!! The design is amazing, the staff is really great, the lounge at night is wonderful party every night. The place smells glamour and cool luxury!!!!"
Hudson Hotel,Dec 26 2008 ,ok for the $,"this hotel was ok. it took over an hour for my room to be ready. we paid for an upgrade but never got one. the lobby was under construction and it was a pain to get anywhere. the rooms were tiny. they werent so clean. for my purposes, it was very far west. if you are going to do broadway, then it is a great location. very loud but close to the shows. everything i did was on the east side so it was far. hotel was very loud inside. make sure you do not have a garden room on a sat night....you hear everything!!"
Hudson Hotel,Dec 26 2008 ,pretentious and poor value,"This hotel prides iteself on being &quot;hip&quot; but it is merely pretentious. Their &quot;standard&quot; room is smaller than most closets I've seen. The halls are so dark you can barely see to put the keycard in. The bathroom provides very low light including a lighted makeup mirror whose lighting is set for crypt level. What they call a &quot;canteen&quot; are merely vending machines and don't come close to what they like to call &quot;a whimsical Concierge floor&quot;...even Motel 6 offers tea and coffee service in the rooms...this place doesn't. When first checking in we remarked that there was no name or number on the building and were told &quot;if you don't know where it is you don't belong here&quot;. The towels were good quality and the front desk staff were pleasant, however. The location is great."
Hudson Hotel,Dec 26 2008 ,Doesn't meet its own high opinion of itself,"This hotel is trying desperaely to be cutting edge. hence the dark corridors and rooms. Advice: bring a flashlight so you can see the contents of your suitcase.When I arrived it was chaos outside and I had to drag my own cases into the lobby (on a bitter cold evening after a 12 hour flight - no I wasn't happy). When I left the next afternoon I had to hail my own cab outside and drag my bags out again as it was chaos once again.Check in was efficient but perfunctory. When I eventually found my room down endless litter-strewn dark hallways I found it was occupied. Back to the front desk where they gave me another room, supposdely an &quot;upgrade&quot; which I think meant on a higher floor, not a larger room. Street noise was loud. Room tiny. This hotel needs to focus on guest service rather than decor and trying to be hip. I got a good rate and would be much more unhappy if I'd paid the regular rate. Don't think I'd stay here again unless it was a great deal."
Hudson Hotel,Dec 20 2008 ,Warning! Proceed with caution,"Firstly I have stayed in some wonderful hotels around the world including &quot;to cool for school places like the Hudson. Like other reviewers the bar areas are good but £100 for 8 drinks (not champers) is a little on the &quot;rich&quot; side.The staff as well on the whole were good and the concierge was great.Now the important stuff,* They only had the queen delux room we booked with a shower when we needed a bath, and by the generator so a terrible noise (ask if you are on the 4/5/6th floors its noisy. So they put us in their standard room, for one night and then upgraded us to a studio on the second (nice I thought). The standard room is a joke. No where to put suitcases and I could not fit through the bathroom door without going side on (I'm not overly wide!). We were there with friends and they also tried to pass a standard room off as a deluxe with them - they were moved and not happy.In our first night room (2345) the coat hook was falling off, the bath tap fell off, the caravan effect wood pannelling was loose on the on the door frame, the spot light was coming away from the ceiling, the shower rail had screw holes protuding where they had messed up the installation. I have to say as well in our shoe box the I really did not see the &quot;design&quot; theme in the artex ceiling. The beds were single matress on a frame ( sheets were good), towels were YMCA size and qualityIt was just a shoddy, claustrophobic, cynical attempt to house those people who get so nailed in the bars the wouldnt notice the room size and quality.The hallways were dark and two fire exit signs on the 23rd floor were loose.On the second night the &quot;studio&quot; room was a reasonable size for a normal room. Apparantly having a &quot;seating area&quot; (read a two person sofa at the back of the room) made it a studio. The room was 1617. Better fitting in this room, but a floor board was raised and there looked to be damp or sometype of poor fix over the shower and the bed springs in the wire frame bed were noisyNow the piece that really sealed the fate of this hotel from our perspective.Our friends were staying in the hotel and I thought to buy them a botttle of champers on room service ($165 for a bottle of Veuve anyone?) My wife bought another present for them, so I asked to cancel the bottle (I had signed). It was not opened and in perfect condition and our friends were were not in the room, so it could have been retrieved. Two managers told me I had signed and they would not take it back, even though I requested this 10mins after signing and I offered to pay the $18 service and $4 delivery charge. I'm still in dispute on this one. (There were 3 other disputes going on as we checked out)I know this is long but I wanted to be precise and descriptive.In summary, over priced, poor quality, cynically small rooms, but with generally nice staff. Stay somewhere else and if you really m ust, enjoy the bar."
Hudson Hotel,Dec 18 2008 ,Hip but cramped not good for business travel,"This was my second stay at the Hudson. First the good things. Lobby, restaurants, and bar are very hip and fun. View from the rooftop is awesome. Location is super. No coffee pot in the room, but Time Warner Center is right across the street and Starbucks is a block away. Very close to Central Park and Lincoln Center. Also, the bed was like a big fluffy futon (on a wooden platform) but really comfortable.I heard a lot of European accents on elevator, so this must be a favorite for international travelers.Now the not so good. Staff is so caught up in being hip they forget they're supposed to take care of guests. (However, the bellmen are super -- they offered to lock up my computer in their safe while I was in meetings.)The regular rooms are smaller than the inside cabin of a cruise ship. If you sit on the toilet in the bathroom, you bump your knees against the opposite wall. Really, it's that small. If you're alone, it's not so bad. Last time I was there with my spouse for 3 days and it got very tight. There's no place to put a 2nd suitcase, so we had to put it on the floor beside the bed and step on it to walk around.Hallways are painted charcoal gray and you feel like you're moving through a cave. A little creepy. I also had so much cold air and noise from the window I checked to see if it was open. Bring earplugs if you want to sleep.This is not an easy hotel for a business traveller. The business center was OK (4-5 computer stations, 2 printers, unattended). I went there at 8:30 PM to print out my presentation for the next morning and the b/w printer was out of toner. I didn't get this message until I had swiped my credit card and paid for 15 minutes of computer time. The concierge said &quot;Well I don't know how soon I can get someone up there&quot; (sounded like she was yawning). I told her I would come to her desk and use her printer. She didn't refuse, and she requested a refund for my card. After all that, my card was charged double the quoted rate and I had to make multiple calls to get it credited. I think they're much more concerned with running the swanky bar than with keeping their business travellers comfortable. They make a lot more money from the bar. Just something good to know if you're trying to work from your room.The business travellers in my office love Le Parker Meridien. Cost was only $25 more than the Hudson. Next time that's where I'll go."
Hudson Hotel,Dec 17 2008 ,Think twice,"Hi all,We stayed at this hotel during our honeymoon and would like to warn other before doing so. The rooms are very small for the price you pay, the staff are not that friendly and we had a piece of jewellery go missing from our room. Even worse our attempts to report the missing jewellery were treated like a joke by reception and security and despite filing 4 reports with hotel security and follow up calls, we are still waiting on a response. I have asked to speak to a hotel management and keep being put through to security who take down my details and say they will get back to me (which has not occurred once).Would you feel safe leaving your personal belongings here?"
Hudson Hotel,Dec 15 2008 ,Terrible Horrible Sleepless and Bugs,"What an awful experience at the Hudson! Lets see- the first room had a cock roach in it (waited 20 minutes to speak to a manger who never came out nor followed up on this). Second room- smelled like smoke (which the front desk never mentioned), the heater was broken, a shelf was falling off in the bathroom, and the floor was bubbled and sinking by the bathroom.  Third room- another broken heater but this one sounded like someone was inside banging a wrench on the pipes all night!!! plus the mini bar was barely stocked (which we took a picture of and made a copy of all the things that were missing so we would not be held responsible for it).  Check-out FINALLY a manager &quot;had time&quot; to discuss the situations with us and comp our parking- a whole $110. Two nights, three horrible rooms and then.... when I checked my credit card at the end of the week there was a $94.24 charge from the Hudson- for the mini bar!! **DO NOT STAY HERE! the lobby and lounge were beautiful (but maybe they should put some of the money back into keeping up with room maintenance), the concierge and valet amazing- but the rest of the headaches are not even comparable to be worth it. Jennifer Price"
Hudson Hotel,Dec 15 2008 ,Super Cool Spot,"I've stayed in several places in NY but this has to be the coolest spot in the city. Ok, the rooms are a little on the small side and the lobby area can feel more like a nightclub after dark, but that's what makes this place so funky. Prices are on the high side (especially for us poor Brits now) but it's a great location near Central Park. There's an awesome little diner across the road (Flames) which serves great comfort food at really low prices. So much is within walking distance from here - I'll definitely be coming back here on my next trip."
Hudson Hotel,Dec 15 2008 ,Just Okay - Location makes up for some negatives,"The location is great - super-close to Columbus Circle, Central Park, Broadway, and we walked to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and more. The hotel was a safe and somewhat clean place to sleep. We were treated respectfully but indifferently by most of the staff, but the bellhops were really great. Beyond that I don't have much good to say. I get that the decor is supposed to be funky, modern, and edgy, but it is downright weird in two areas - the outside of the hotel and the hallways. Outside there is no sign, no indication at all that it is a hotel. It's a good thing our taxi driver knew where he was going. Look at the photo on the hotel website and take away the bright yellow lights and cleanliness, and that's what it looks like. The entire hotel is much too dark. Seriously consider taking a flashlight along!!! The hallways are yuck. Very tight, very dark, almost scary - painted a dark gray color from floor to ceiling, trim to doors. You can't even tell where the elevators are because they are painted the same dark color as everything else and have no lighting. They felt dirty, too. It seemed like they were super-dark to hide how run-down and dirty they were. The hotel's website says the rooms are modeled after ship cabins. The teeny tiny size is the only thing about the rooms that resemble ship cabins. The hallways are definitly like the hallways of a navy submarine! Our room was one of the bigger ones in that it had space at the end of the bed, side tables, and a tiny desk and chair. The pillows and matress were worn out, the floor was very dusty, and the windows were useless to keep out the cold wind and noise. The heater was loud and clangy too. The bathroom was ridiculously small, though clean enough. We had to sit sideways on the toilet because there wasn't enough room for our knees the regular way. To get into the teeny shower, we had to climb over the toilet. I really didn't like this hotel b/c doesn't come near the descriptions on the company webiste, and because it is sooo dark!!! But the location is great."
Hudson Hotel,Dec 13 2008 ,It's Okay.,It is a hip hotel but has really small rooms. It is walking distance from central park and restaurants and a short cab ride to go shopping. Christine Baranda
Hudson Hotel,Dec 11 2008 ,overrated,"We paid via Expedia and paid far more than the rate shown on the website.The manager refused to address our concerns or to offer a discount because he said we had booked through Expedia.The rooms were dark,poorly equipped with no electical socket near a mirror and one of the three rooms we stayed in was next to the control A/C generator and was very very noisy all night.In our third room the heating broke down,in mid winter too.The worst element was the state and size of the bathrooms.A bath so small you had to squat in it,a toilet so crammed in that your knees hit the wall when you sat down.No space to put any toiletries and overall a disgrace.This ex girls dormitory hotel passes itself off as quaint and trendy.The public rooms may just pass but the 3 rooms that we stayed in were all sub standard and we were charged £350 per night.We are still fighting for a refund.Take my advice avoid this hotel at any price."
Hudson Hotel,Dec 10 2008 ,The Hudson - Hip Hop And Happenning!,"Well, what can I say about the Hudson that hasn't already been said?...This is quite possibly the funkiest hotel I have ever stayed in. It's in a great location close to Central Park and Columbus Circle subway station and has some great ameneties nearby (diners/drug store etc). The bar and restaurant are great and the welcome you get is outstanding...As for the food...WOW!Yes, the rooms are small but let's face it, you're in a city that never sleeps so what else do you need apart from a bed to rest your weary head after a hard day/night?!"
Hudson Hotel,Dec 9 2008 ,A waste of money - I ended up with a black eye the room was so small,"We booked this hotel for a weekend break in New York. When I arrived the doorman was very friendly and efficient, I was very impressed. Sadly that was the best experience I had at the hotel. I arrived at the check in desk alone, my partner was arriving an hour after me. They asked for a credit card, I didn't have one but said my partner would be along in one hour to check in and that they could have the card details then. I was told I couldn't check in until I had a credit card or a $150 deposit. I was very tiered after a long trip and very angry at being treated like I'd empty the mini bar and do a runner in one hour. We had just paid £1200 for a 4 night stay, I was not impressed.I finally managed to check in leaving a $100 deposit (all I had on me) and arrived at my room. On the Hudson website it says styled on cabins from an old fashioned yacht, they forgot to mention the room was the size of a cabin on a yacht, tiny. I ended up with a black eye after getting out of bed and smacking my eye on the TV on the wall as it was so close to the bed!Next the bathroom, absolutely tiny, I'm only 5ft tall and quite small. Sitting on the loo my knees nearly touched the wall in front. The shower head in the shower was absolutely black with scum (looked like it had never been cleaned) and the base of the bath had worn away to reveal the concrete underneath the enamel. There were hairs all up the walls and around the bath too.As for dusting and cleaning, I don't think the room had been cleaned for at least a couple of weeks there was thick dust everywhere and marks on the sides where other guests had spilt drinks etc.The Hudson does have a couple of good points. The bar is very trendy although very pricey, 2 glasses of champagne each nearly £100. Breakfast at the hotel is very good, although the canteen is so dark you can hardly see what you're eating. In fact the whole hotel is so dark including the corridors and rooms I recommend you take a torch with you!"
Hudson Hotel,Dec 8 2008 ,Kind of Nice Wouldn't Stay Again,"This boutique hotel we stayed at for 2 nights, and it was a Priceline booking. The good: Location, modern decor, friendly staffThe bad: Street sounds very noisy, mattress could have been softer, room extremely small.This is not a room you want to stay in and lounge around, as there is just enough room for a bathroom, one suitcase, and the bed. The TV is a flatscreen that hangs on the wall, and there is a little table- that is about it. The worst thing was the street noise. They need to upgrade the windows to make the room quieter, because I awoke several times in the night due to car alarms and honking, and we were on the 14th floor. The location was great. We walked to the MOMA, the public library, Bryant Park, Times Square, and were just steps away from Central Park. I would not stay again however, because of the tight quarters and noisy street sounds that filtered in easily."
Hudson Hotel,Dec 6 2008 ,Great Hotel Very friendly,"We recently stayed at the Hudson for 5 nights and loved it! Ok so the rooms aren't huge but having read the reviews I expected them to be tiny but the room was more than comfortable for the two of us with plenty of hanging space for clothes etc. The bathroom is small but I've seen smaller! This is New York after all and we were only in the hotel to sleep and change clothes!As for the staff being unfriendly I couldn't disagree more - in our experience receptionists were all helpful &amp; friendly, doormen always said good morning and welcome back when we returned.We were there for thanksgiving so asked for and got lots of advice from reception about where to go etc and (I say again!) they couldn't have been more helpful.We had a night flight home and asked for a late check out - TOP TIP! they will extend your check out time to 2pm at no extra cost but after that you have to pay half a day's rate so we opted for the 2pm check out &amp; left the bags with the doormen after that.We were on the 19th floor so can't comment about noise from the bars etc so my only suggestion re the rooms is to ask for a rear facing room as ours was over the street and (this being New York and all) it was quite noisy but did quieten off later, we just got some earplugs!For breakfast we went to the place on the corner of the same block for the first day but would absolutely recommend crossing over to the one opposite called 'Flame' - much better value, service and comfort!"
Hudson Hotel,Dec 5 2008 ,Great for a Night on the Town,"Stayed at the Hudson Hotel to enjoy a night in New York City. Great location for any event in Midtown, close to Columbus Circle subway station with quick connection to Grand Central Terminal. I stayed in the smallest room. The area was very small, but the cleanliness of every thing was worth it. I am a tall man and I found the bed to be comfortable. The small room is good for one night out; but I will happily pay more for a bigger room if I am staying longer."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 29 2008 ,An excellent hotel,"If there is one thing that should make you visit this hotel it is the rooftop garden! Sipping cocktails whilst watching the sunset over Manhatten was a wonderful beginning and ending to a fantastic holiday. From the moment that we walked into the hotel we were impressed with the facilities and staff who could not have been more helpful. The location on upper west side was fantastic for seeing the city - the nearest subway was at the end of the block accompanied by a shopping mall with some excellent shops. The rooms although very compact were very clean, modern and had their own stereo. The restaurant was excellent in a cafeteria style where you could watch your food being cooked. I really could not recommend the hotel high enough - having stayed at other hotels in new york this hotel won hands down as a great base for seeing new york."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 26 2008 ,Yes Small Rooms But Nice Hotel,"I had read the reviews and looked at the pictures on the internet so I had a good idea what we were getting into. We had also been to the bar on a previous visit so we knew how to find the hotel. (Hint - Look for the flame and the bushes)The room is small and about the smallest I have stayed in NYC. But we only paid $179 and we were staying for only one night. With those parameters, it was just fine. I would also say that based on some of the reviews I would have thought the property was run down, but not at all. The room was well appointed and the amenities were fine.I would check out the hotel's website and look at one of the rooms, before you book. It gives you a great idea of what they have. My only real complaint was that the beds were low to the floor and to get in and out over the course of the night was a pain (I'm getting old)."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 25 2008 ,Great time in NYC at the Hudson,"We booked for 4 nights at the Hudson through Priceline and were sceptical due to lots of negative reviews on this site. However, don't be put off by these - we had a good time at the hotel. Yes, the rooms are on the compact side - but they were spotless (cleaned daily) and so well designed that it never felt too cramped. There was plenty of space for 2 adults, 2 large suitcases and plenty of shopping. Shower was hot and had a variety of power settings.The lobby is a bit TOO dark, but check in was speedy and efficent.Drinks and food were expensive at the hotel (both in the bars and room service/minibar) but there are plenty of reasonably priced diners nearby.Location superb - just round the corner from Central Park and a 2 minute walk from Columbus Circle Subway with easy access to all the sights.Recommended"
Hudson Hotel,Nov 25 2008 ,Mediocre stay bad service,"The hotel is very eclectic and fun, but there are some issues. First if you don't know where it is, you will never find it. There are no signs. The only thing you see is a yellow light coming out of the door...that is it. The bar is fun and amazing. Lots of pretty people. The hotel rooms leave a lot to be desired. Small in size and need renovations. Not as clean as I thought. Amenities are ok. Valet parking for 1 hour is $55 and drinks are regular NY price at $15.00 a pop. Staff is rude, not accomodating and slow. Food was not good, yet very expensive. At $500 a night for a rather small room with no view, you would think the staff would be nicer. No one wants to help you!"
Hudson Hotel,Nov 23 2008 ,Okay the rooms are small - but the location is ace,"If you've read any of the other reviews of the Hudson on this site, the one thing you'll know is that the rooms are small. Very small.If you trawl around on here, someone has posted a video which shows you how small. In short though, the bedroom, is a double bed with maybe a foot or two around three sides of it, and the bathroom is nudged up against that, maybe four foot by two-and-a half.But come on; it's New York. Unless you're willing to pay a fortune, rooms are going to be tiny.My girlfriend and I stayed here for five nights in mid November and paid about $300 per night (including taxes) and actually, the size of the room was never a problem.And on the plus side for the room, it was quiet once you got in, the bed was really comfy, the heating was good for those cold New York nights, and when you wanted a bit of fresh air you could throw the window open and suck in that 58th Street air. Elsewhere, the hotel was great. The library bar was very cool, and worth a visit for a cocktail (although the prices will probably mean that's a treat rather than a regular occurrence), and the chandelier over the check-in desk with holographic light bulbs is worth a closer look. But the best thing about this place is its location. Right there on Columbus Circle with its three (or four - I forget) subway lines running through. If you're going to stay here, shell out $25 for a week's subway pass and travel everywhere on the tube. You'll save yourself a fortune on taxi fares or shoe leather, and you can get practically everywhere on Manhattan with a ten minute train ride and a ten minute walk."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 22 2008 ,Pros and Cons,"Pros:-The location of the Hudson is ideal. You can walk to lots of popular sights and restaurants and are an easy taxi ride from the rest.-The staff was very professional and efficient. We used their help several times for directions and reservations.-The bar downstairs is very trendy and popular. If that's your sort of thing then you have a great place to go right in the hotel.Cons:-Yes, the rooms are small. But in the Hudson's defense, when you book online they give you the exact size of the room you are booking. -Our room was very cold. We were there during one of the first cold spells of the winter and our room was never any warmer than 60 degrees F though we had the thermostat turned all the way up.-Drinks in the bar are very expensive. I was expecting NYC prices but $25/drink?-Breakfast was mediocre. I was hoping for better.So, it's not the best hotel in NYC but it's not the worse either. I will not be staying there again but it was not bad enough to consider moving to another hotel during our stay."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 21 2008 ,New york new york,The Hudson was clean but very unfriendly and the bedrooms small and dull. I also found this hotel hard to find. Near the theatre but on the whole I was dissappointed.
Hudson Hotel,Nov 20 2008 ,Acceptable but small room and weird lobby,"I knew something was strange when I walked right by the Hudson: there is no sign outside the door. Two doormen were muttering &quot;Hudson Hotel?&quot; in the furtive sotto voce I usually associate with sidewalk dealers asking &quot;Want some herb?&quot;.Once I had located the hotel, I ascended a long escalator to the lobby. The entrance, lobby, and some other common areas are lit in a creepy yellow-green fluorescent. Perhaps I'm too old to understand chic, but to me it resembled Minas Morgul in the Lord of the Rings movie. The lobby itself is so dim I almost walked into other guests more than once.These are not the smallest rooms in NYC. I have stayed in the Paramount and they are even smaller. The bed occupies almost the entire room, the shower is at the foot of the bed, separated by only a curtain, and the toilet is on the far side of the shower. I was actually rather impressed with the room's utilization of space, putting the stereo in the closet and a TV hinged to the wall. I was reminded of rooms in some Japanese hotels (except in Japan, the bedding is also very short).I got this hotel from Priceline as a 3-1/2 star. The price was (very) right, but that extra half-star compared to their other listings is bogus. The experience is in contrast to unrefurbished hotels with larger rooms (e.g., Salisbury and Wellington); on balance I think I prefer the latter.I should also mention that the female staff (check-in, concierge, restaurant hostess, and waitress) were all so cheery I wonder how many male guests get the wrong idea."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 11 2008 ,Shocked and in need of a Chiropractor,I have stayed at the various Morgen hotel group hotels throughout the years and have always been impressed but this time I was seriously underwhelmed.The lobby was cool and chic and the halls reminded me of othe boutique Hotels out there but when I go to the room and opened the door it was like a closet. There was barely enough room for the double bed whose mattress was a glorified futon. My body still hurts from sleeping on it. The HVAC unit ran so loud and swung wildly in it's temperature range that it was impossible to get comfortable. The flat screen TV has position whereby if you slanted it towards the bed just so you could see it.; you lost valuable walking space around the bed not to mention the fact you still had to crook your neck to see it. The bathroom has a petite round bowl toilet that if any male over 5' 10' tried to sit his knees would be jammed against the wall. You could easily stay almost anywhere in NYC for $500 and have clean modern accommodations. So why would you ever do it here. Certainly not for inclusive parking and a cafeteria style Old Country Buffet breakfast. The place it filled with European travelers who might be acustomed to small digs but I think even they were taken back.
Hudson Hotel,Nov 9 2008 ,Nice idea but terribly small rooms,"Lovely, modern hotel in a great location of NYC. Very intriguing lobby and bars. BUT, when you get to the room it all goes down hill. Rooms are so small (mine was 136 sq ft). My laptop didn't fit on the &quot;desk&quot; and there were not enough outlets to power my laptop w/o unplugging other things. I can't imagine how or where one would eat room service. Noise was also a problem. I had to check to make certain my window wasn't open because the street noise was incredible. You also hear everything in the halls. Bottomline, this place is not for a business traveler. And unless you plan to spend 99% of time outside of the room on a pleasure trip, then Hudson Hotel may not be for you either. I'll not stay there again."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 6 2008 ,maybe if you're 5 ft tall.,"While I agree the public spaces are nice, you're better off visiting them as a non-guest. The rooms are small and badly designed. The bathroom was so small that foot would not even fit between the wall edge and the toilet bowl. It made an airplane toilet look spacious in comparison. I got tired of banging my knees into the wall or hitting my head when I stood up and just went down to the lobby to go.The large mirrors on the wall were undoubtedly to give a sense of space, it didn't work. The placement of the tv was awkward. The candy dish mounted on the other side of the room as a remote control holder was just - stupid. My husband banged his head on the tv getting out of the bed. The mattress itself was not very comfortable and I prefer to be more than 12 inches off the ground. If you're under 5'5 weigh less than 130 and aren't clausterphobic you might like the hotel. The more you veer from that description, the less pleasant you'll find it."
Hudson Hotel,Nov 4 2008 ,Business travellers DO NOT go to the Hudson,"If you are travelling for business the last thing you need is a tiny room (about one metre around the size of the double bed) with no place to put your suitcase, unless you are travelling with a small trolley. A even if you have a trolley there is not enough space to take inside the room. It has to stay in a ...tiny closet in the corridor. There is only one tiny table just about the size of the laptop and and tiny (sic!) bathroom. The lobby is weird and dark with odd plants growing on the ceiling and on the walls. Maybe a cool place for just one night...to be spent mostly outside of the hotel. The staff was also rude and unhelpful. Overall, it's a very pretentious hotel trying to be cool.... at rather high rates! One of my worst experiences travelling on business."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 22 2008 ,Trendy Clean - You get what you pay for,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel on a Sunday night. Service staff was friendly, room was clean and amenities were as described. The place looks exactly like the photos on the website. European style hotel with trendy decor and small rooms. Baggage check held our bags for free after our check-out while we spent the day in the city. Location was great as it was very close to the subway and near central park."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 21 2008 ,Rude impolite arrogant presumptuous haughty,"Or any other definition you might want to add. We planned to meet another couple for drinks in one of the lobby bars. At the first club, the cartoonish &quot;doorman&quot; in red vest and matching red sneakers stated there was not enough room to accomodate us although we could see plenty of seats available. We then proceeded to the &quot;library&quot; for a drink. Although crowded we were able to secure a table for the 4 of us but were promptly told that the table was reserved. We asked if we could sit and talk until the reservation showed up. Well, they did.... over one hour late.... and we were summarily asked to leave. We then carried our extremely expensive drinks out to the lobby area where we found three seats together. We pulled a fourth chair over to accomodate all of us and were informed that we were not permitted to move chairs in the lobby. We then carried our drinks to the restaurant bar and were again informed we could not enter with drinks form another establishment (from the bar across the lobby?).In summary, if you desire snotty and presumptuous staff in an over-hyped and over-priced establishment; have at it.... otherwise steer very clear of Hudson Hotel."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 19 2008 ,Great Place For Girl Trip!,"I have never bothered writing a review before- however, I felt obligated to share our positive experience after reading the negatives! We just came back from a 3 night stay- I was skeptical after the reviews.....First of all, our cab driver had NO problem getting us there, we had NO problem identifing the building....NO problem checking in- (approx 1 min. wait in line-around 2:30 p.m.) David was very polite and professional:). Our standard room was located on the 10th floor with a nice city view. The room was cozy, so limit the amount of luggage you bring! We had no problem manuvering around our room- just keep tidy! Room was CLEAN, bed was COMFY...bathroom/shower was good enough for getting the job done! We had 20&quot; flat screen tv &amp; A nice stereo that we could jam to while getting ready for a night out! -bring your cd's. The hotel staff was friendly, housekeeping did a fantastic job! We shared a large tasty shrimp dish at the hotel restraunt for $23. Bar scene was like a bunch of NY 'ers having a high school reunion- the locals party there (makes it interesting!). We were leary @ first,- by our last night, we tore the dance floor up! If you have to buy a mixed drink it will be $12.- We made our own bar in our room! Hotel location was GREAT- 1 blk from subway. Central park is 2 blks away. There are plenty of local places to eat for a decent price especially if you can split the meal with your co-traveler! We had a great time there, I would stay again.....the only negative that is hardly worth mentioning is the dimly lit hall that could use a little touch-up! Over-all ....It' s the perfect place for leisure. I don't think this is a place for family reunions or work related activities:)"
Hudson Hotel,Oct 18 2008 ,Fashionable Great Location Compact Rooms...,"I'll bullet point my thoughts rather than write a novel:1. The Hudson is very trendy - checking in late on Friday night is like checking into a nightclub (dark, trendy people everywhere and loud music)... not that that is a bad thing just different!2. The 15th floor roof terrace is lovely and you dont feel obliged to buy anything - can just lie in the sunshine3. Bedrooms are very very small and not very bright however the beds are very comfortable, the shower great and the rooms are cleverly done to maximise the space available. We had a queen room which was fine - to be honest on a city break you are just sleeping there not hanging around all day.4. Service was great - everyone from reception to concierge and cleaners were friendly.5. The hotel is very relaxed about you bringing in your own food - something UK hotels hate... there are often people in the lifts with pizza and beers etc. (much cheaper than buying in-house)6. Location is fantastic - a couple of great diners very close by for breakfast - try Route 66. You can also walk to central park / rockerfeller centre / time square etc. Tube also nearby. Most cabbies know where the hotel is (even though it doesnt look like a hotel and has no signage outside) but remember the address cos one cabbie had no idea.Overall the downsides are the size of the rooms and the dark corridors but its a very cool hotel perfect for a city break - think you have to be young at heart though we saw a couple of older people who looked a little perplexed &amp; its definitely not the place for little kids even though we saw some there."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 17 2008 ,Not sure,"I stayed at the Hudson with my friend on a 4 night girly trip to NYC.Fabulously tendy yes, but not really that much else to recommend it.We paid around £150/night for a Deluxe (bigger than standard) through Expedia, but upgraded to a double double room for an additional $60 as there were no twin bedded rooms available. This room was a pretty good size, with 2 queen sized beds, and seems to be a world apart from standard rooms. There's just about enough hanging space (open rail by the door) but not enough hangers, no drawers, and a space to put suitcase &amp; shopping.Lovely crisp cotton bedding with feather pillows &amp; duvet, but I requested a change as I am allergic &amp; it didn't actually happen until the 2nd day. Obviously very stylish decor and a decent flat screen TV (again, better than in a standard room).The bathroom was an OK size too (another benefit of the larger room) and didn't have the glass partition but instead a real solid wall and door. Top tip - the hairdryer is hung on the back of the bathroom door! Lots of trendy and luxurious accessories, but beware of the cost - the scented candles are not complimentary! No minibar but some extortionately-priced snacks and soft drinks.Although stylish, the rooms are really only the standard of an average Travelodge and are starting to need refurbishment.As others have commented, public areas are incredibly dark and actually quite depressing, especially the corridors.Rooftop terrace and outside bar are both quite lovely, and the former has the advantage of being for residents only.Elsewhere, in the garden bar and main bar, there is absolutely no preferential treatment for hotel residents - willingness to commit to bottle service appears to be the only way of securing a table, and at $300 for a bottle of vodka! This is probably the element that made me quite dislike the Hudson. At the weekend the bar is packed, with a velevet rope entry policy. In the garden bar, there was no chance of a table and we had to queue up for $18 drinks. On a quiet Monday, we were 'allowed' a table in the bar but only a small one and could not have a decent table for our party of 5 (even though the place was empty) because we did not want to purchase a bottle of spirits or champagne.Overall, OK but only 3* standard and with an approach to customer service that is beyond pretentious!"
Hudson Hotel,Oct 15 2008 ,It's a scam,"We booked this hotel through Priceline. After reading reviews we were a little disappointed. The rooms are extreamely small, but read in other reviews that we can upgrade to a larger room for $30 extra per night. (Staff origianally asked for $60 but then negotiated to $30). My sister and I checked in and we were assigned a queen bed, entire hotel room is 150 sq. ft. We asked for an upgrade. They gave us a room with a king bed, 230 sq. ft, for an additional $60 per night and were told that if we had booked directly with the hotel we would have paid less than through Priceline. I felt that we were being scammed. We checked in and the room is especially compact. This was unacceptable. We returned to the front desk and were told by another staffer that it would have been chepaer booking direct. We asked to speak to the manager and he said if we were not happy he would cancel our reservation. We took him up on his offer. Within 15 minutes, Priceline refunded our money and rebooked us at the Hilton Millenium for the same price."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 14 2008 ,Dreadful,"Stayed here for 3 nights and it was the worst experience I have had in NYC! Our hotel room was not ready, and there were no more non-smoking rooms left when we checked in. The hotel did not try to offer any viable solutions for us--just &quot;sorry, check back with us tomorrow&quot;). The hotel tries too hard to be trendy and hip. It is nothing more than a big noisy nightclub with thumping techno music 24 hours a day! The walls are paper-thin and you can hear everything going on in the surrounding rooms and hallways (and the hotel seems to be booked mostly by 20 year olds, so fill-in-the-blank about the types of noise you will hear at all hours of the night). The street noise is also very loud, as well as the music from the club/bars in the hotel. The rooms are not built for comfort, and there is just one tiny electric heater/AC unit on the wall (the the unit is also NOISY). The drinks at the bar are $16 each (am I being cheap? Is that the going rate for a drink?). The highlight of the hotel is that it is located diagonal from the Columbus Circle subway stop. Please stay elsewhere and save yourself a headache."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 13 2008 ,Great Design But You Can't Sleep in the Lobby,"As a design student, I've heard rave reviews about the Hudson. The public spaces are amazing and I recommend a visit to the bars and outside spaces. However, I would not recommend staying there. I travel to NYC quite often, and travel tons for work. This is the smallest room I have ever seen in the city, and frankly, my room on my last cruise was bigger; for example, you have to negotiate the toilet bowl to climb into the shower--beware handicapped travelers! About our average stay: 1) the staff greeted us with a smoking room, and made it clear we were &quot;less than&quot; because we booked on Priceline (for what turned out to be full price), 2) our room was not serviced by housekeeping (we had to call daily), 3) the bathroom pocket-door didn't work (causing a bit more intimacy than we wanted) - we called the desk 3 times for the bathroom only to be told that engineering was &quot;on its way.&quot; -- engineering never showed."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 7 2008 ,The worst hotel I have ever stayed in for £120 a night,"NO HEATING - aparently they only put the heating on when it reaches 45F. We had to sit in blankets in the room!DARK DINGY CORRIDORS - yes they maybe trendy for under 25's. If you are over 40 or have kids, DONT STAY HERE.Corridors look like a prison.ROOMS - PRISON CELL SIZE. I HAVE BEEN TO YOUTH HOSTELS THAT ARE WARMER AND LARGER. NO CURTAINS - so you cant keep the cold out.NO TEA/COFFEE.IT'S A CONVERTED GOVERNMENT APARTMENT BUILDING AND IT SHOWS (THATS WHY THEY CANT PUT THE HEATING ON)We checked out after one day. It was that bad. Book the Park Central around the corner. It is wamer, larger and cheaper.All you are paying for at the Hudson is some 'trendy' paint and gloomy 'hip' lighting.We also stayed in the Club Quarters at the Rockfeller centre. It was pure luxary compared to this dump, I am 45 and went with one child. I cant even begin to think what would have happened if my mother or anyone with poor eyesight booked this hotel, They probably would have fallen over or into something."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 2 2008 ,like it or not,"We booked via Expedia and we got a really small room next to a noisy airco unit. The room was too small so we went back to the reception and we asked for a bigger room. We had to pay 60$/day extra which we could bring down to 30$ - the room was a little bigger! The interior is really cool, nice reception, nice restaurants and nice bars. Only one big disappointment is the main bar turns into a club in the evening, every night!! After dinner the hotel lobby was crowded and music was really loud. The smaller bar was also crowded so it was difficult to get a drink on Friday and Saturday night in the hotel. Breakfast was great. NY is a great city and we enjoyed our stay in NY."
Hudson Hotel,Oct 1 2008,Great hotel if you find a deal,"My husband and I stayed for 5 nights at the Hudson Hotel in April while doing the tourist thing in NYC. We were apprehensive before arriving after reading some of the not-so-great reviews of this hotel, but we really enjoyed our stay. We would definitely return, but not at full sticker price. Here are a few things to consider before booking your stay: Yes, it’s true. The rooms are tiny, but they are very efficiently laid-out. The room is also dim due to low lighting, dark wood paneling and a small outside window, but the clear glass pane between the bright (but tiny) bathroom and bedroom helps to lighten up the room. Yes, it’s also true that the hallways are dark too, but it was never a problem for us. There’s is a trendy bar in the lobby that’s hopping on the weekend, so make sure that you request a higher up room if you’re worried about noise. BTW - I was impressed that hotel security checked to make sure that only guests were riding the elevators at night. Check-in was efficient, and the reception staff were friendly - they upgraded us to a larger room after the first night (but to tell you the truth it was hard to tell the difference, it was so small too!) The concierge was really helpful, and even got us into a restaurant (Babbo) that I’d tried booking a month ahead of our arrival but couldn’t get a table. The doorman safely stored our luggage after checking-out so we could still spend our last day exploring NYC baggage-free. Above all else, the location was absolutely terrific – close to Central Park, only a 10 min. walk from Time Square, and 2 blocks from the subway. However, it’s true that there is no sign outside the Hudson, so be sure to look at pictures of the hotel exterior before arriving so that you can find it easily. With all that said, would we stay here again and recommend this hotel to you? Yes, if you’re okay with the above, and find a deal for $200 a night or better."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 26 2008 ,Like a Hobbit Jail Cell,"Great location, the smallest room/bathroom you've ever seen.- Don’t expect to work in your room. The table is hobbit sized; I could barely get my laptop and the mouse on it and there was nowhere to put the overpriced bottles of water that were on the table. - Don’t expect to kick back and relax watching TV – seriously, my IPhone has a larger screen than the TV in the room…and more channels! - Don’t expect to stretch out in the room. I’m pretty tall and I swear I could have touched both walls, the floor and ceiling simultaneously! - Don’t expect to have a relaxing experience whilst performing your ablutions; the bathroom is so small that your knees touch the wall when you sit and think! Really, the bathroom was probably 4 feet wide! - Don’t expect to be able to find the entrance without a spirit guide, the entranceway is better hidden than the entrance to the ministry of magic in the Harry Potter Movies - I complained when I eventually found the hotel that there is no name or number on the outside, the receptionist told me it was part of the character of the hotel. I told her that it was bloody foolish given that most guests were not psychic. - Don’t bring children in to the entrance area – it is so dark you could easily kill a small child with your rolling luggage and not even know about it. If you take small children with you I’d recommend a flashing beacon on their hats or a flashlight just to be careful. I know they think that this is cool but it really just makes the place feel dingy.Don't get me wrong, if you can get a room here for a good price then it is fine – the location is great and the room was clean enough. Just don't bring to much luggage or too many friends."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 25 2008 ,cool hotel,"just returned from a 3 night stay here with our 19and 20 year old son and daughter and they loved it.Bedrooms are small but the rest of the hotel made up for it.It has a fantastic ambiance,good music, good food . Check in was quick and taxis were always readily available.I would recommend here but my husband struggled with the bedroom size,so if you can ,don't stay in a standard room.Don't be put off staying here because of bedroom size because its such a cool place to stay and you will enjoy it"
Hudson Hotel,Sep 24 2008 ,Amazingly different experience!,Despite what you might read from the other reviews please do not let the descriptions on how small the room is from deciding wether you should stay or night. My wife and I stayed at the hudson for a 4 day NYC getaway and simply loved it. The hotel is located right by columbus circle which has a great park for one to sit and people watch as well as access to the central park. The overall look of the hotel is amazing. We were greeted at the front door by the Hudson staff and took the escalator up to the lobby. A very different and unique lobby the Hudson has created. Somewhat dark and cozy with a great music selection playing through the speakers. Yes the rooms are small but the way they have set up the room with its layout and decorations one really does not think twice about the size. We both were very pleased with the room especially with the tv they have on the wall and stereo system. They also have a I pod docking station. The Library bas is a must go for a drink especially the rooftop terrace where you can relax and catch a great view of the city. The Hudson club was packed on Saturday night with a great DJ. I suggest requesting a floor on a higher level. We also recomend the restaurant at the Hudson with a succulent menu. Try the garlic potato fries. Talk about wow!
Hudson Hotel,Sep 24 2008 ,pay $$$$$$ for the designer name,"We've stayed at the hotel for two nites in September 2008.tiny bathrooms most og the rooms featuring only showers. Can't be 2 people in the bathroom at the same time :(((double size beds (not queen nor king) low to the floor. nice furniture quite fanky but not worth the price.spectacular lobby,garden, sky lounge bar very good food downstairs restaurant (great burgers)ok helpfull reception ok customer servicewill not choose to stay at this hotel againB"
Hudson Hotel,Sep 24 2008 ,Nice Hotel Small Room Nice Decoration,"I stayed in The Hudson in December 2006 with my finacee.The hotel is very well decorated and the staff are friendly and helpful with regards to restaraunt recomendations and general service. We stayed 4 days and ate in the restarant once which was a nice experience, you generally sit on a long table with other people which adds to the social aspect The food was of a good quality and we enjoyed our night out.We stayed in a standard bedroom which was very small, which isn't unusual for New York but does take something away from your stay.The Hotel has quite a trendy bar downstairs which seems to be frequented by revel goers on a night out most nights which may not be everyone's cup of tea but if you do venture into it then it does have a good atmosphere.The location is pretty good being near the south west corner of central park and time square within easy walking distance.All in all I had a nice stay but would look to go to a different hotel if I returned to New York in the future."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 23 2008 ,Avoid This Hotel If You're a Larger Person,"The Hudson Hotel rooms are smaller than any I've ever seen, including those in Europe. (Management must be making a killing - I think they took each room during renovations and sliced them in two, but don't charge anywhere near half the rate.) The room is about 8 foot by 16 foot total. The bathroom is so tiny, they use toilets the same size as those used by pre-schools. I found it difficult to, ahem, get a bit of reading in, as the toilet was so tiny and close to the wall that my knees were touching the wall. If you're over 6 foot, you might not be physically capable of using the toilet. The shower stall is so small, you can barely turn around. And the bedroom is so small, it's hard to regulate the temperature and humidity in the room. (And the HVAC system they use has lousy controls.) The bed is one mattress, low to the ground. They desk chair is metal, the desk is tiny. And on the ninth floor, you can hear the boom boom of the music downstairs, with the windows closed. And then, at 3:00 a.m. a bunch of cars honking horns woke me up. They need better windows. Not a pleasant stay. Could use a sign out front too."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 19 2008 ,Not Recommended - Overpriced,"Rooms were extremely small. Even for NYC, just way too small... bed was also small and very close to the ground... NOT COMFORTABLE. Bathroom was tiny tiny, so tiny that there wasn't enough space for my make up bag!Funny fact: My 15'' TV was hidden in the closet and it took me a while to find it, it was literally 17'' at most, remember those really old TVs? yes, it was one of them, it was so old that they had to attach an electronic device to it so that it would work on a remote control... my friend had a big LCD on the wall of his room, which was opposite to mine.The theme of the hotel was nice, the dimmed lights were a good touch, but i just felt that i was staying at a youth hostel in europe, but ten times the price.I paid almost $400 per night, totally ovepriced, totally not worth it"
Hudson Hotel,Sep 17 2008 ,poor maintenance,"Stayed at the Hudson on business after staying in many Morgans Group hotels (Clift, Mondrian LA, Royalton, Morgans, Delano). The first night, the room's air conditioning wasn't working when I checked in and maintenance came up four times to fix. Turned out it was an issue with the circuit breaker which they couldn't fix and the hotel was sold out so they couldn't move me to another room. It was 1:30 am by that point, so didn't want to move. Had to call multiple times to finally speak with a manager since none of my voice mail messages were returned.They moved me to a new room the next day and guess what, the fan on the A/C didn't work in this room. Maintenance spent about 45 minutes working on the unit (at 11pm) and didn't have a new unit to replace it with - and hotel sold out again - so another night without air conditioning. In addition, when trying to access the wireless internet got a &quot;too many connections&quot; error and when I was finally able to connect the speed was so low (similar to a 56K modem as measured by Speakeasy's speedtest) that it was maddening. Overall, a very disappointing experience as I've had many enjoyable experiences at other Morgans Group hotels."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 17 2008,Too cool that they've forgotten the important stuff,"This hotel was fine but so much effort has gone into making it cool that it doesn't &quot;work&quot;. It's too dark to see anything, its freezing, you have to wait 10 minutes for an empty lift, took 1 hour to check in at 11pm, service is appalling, room tiny etc.Its clean though and good location and nice bars. Definitely not worth the money though."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 17 2008 ,beautiful design hotel,"The Hudson has all the hallmarks of Philippe Starck design, beautiful common spaces, really stunning, the light bar is particularly special. The overall theme of the hotel is of a college, so there is a big library room, and many places to sit, see and be seen.The rooms are very small, not even space to lay out your suitcase, and the see-through glass showers may not be everyone's cup of tea. But if you are not a roombody, then this is a stunningly beautiful hotel. service was great, food was pricey, but delicious. Drinks are VERY expensive in the bars, but then you are paying for the amazing spaces."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 13 2008 ,More funky than a funky funky thing...,"I found the hotel easy to find - but I dont think there is a sign post... just check out the images from the website - if you can remember what it looks like you wont have any problems locating it, which is suggested in some reviews.It is beautiful inside - the ivy covred lobby ceiling is really impressive. The staff at check in are polite, professional, friendly and helpful.The rooms are small, but really clean, and the bed was very comfy. Housekeeping is really good.. the room was cleaned thoroughly every day.there was a CD player in my room, so i sort of wished that i'd taken a couple of cds to listen to while i was getting ready.the freebie toiletries are nice enough.I stayed over a long weekend, and the hotel has a very buzzy atmosphere on friday and saturday nights.. i was returning from a long day of sight seeing, so it wasnt really the best place for me as I'd have liked to have proped myself somewhere for a quiet cup of coffee in the evening, just for half an hour before bed.. but maybe im getting a little old!! but - if you're away with the girls, then its really fabulous - be sure to book a table in the outside bar area if you're wanting to have drinks there.. its really pricey though, we paid $40 for a round consisting of an orange juice, lager, and a bellini, the drinks were lovely,and the service was ok. but i thought $40 was a bit steep.check out was before 12noon, and quick and easy, and you can store your luggage while you spend time in the city before going back to the airport... the doorman will collect your bags if you present the little ticket at the door on street level. thats nice and easy.all in all - great hotel... absolutely fabulous location, and perfect if youre really going for it in terms of sight seeing.. also if you're with the girls, or part of a couple who likes the bar scene, then the bars are great. rooms clean, comfy.. all in all very very good!"
Hudson Hotel,Sep 10 2008 ,Chic but not great!,"The lobby was beautiful! Unfortunately, that is where it ends! The hallways were scary! Dark and dingy. The rooms were ridiculously small. I have been traveling to NYC for 20 years and I know about the room sizes that can be found in most hotels, this was ridiculous. I paid TOO MUCH - almost $400 per night. Horrible value. The bed was terribly uncomfortable, more like a cheap futon mattress. The lighting in the rooms and bathroom was unacceptable. I could barely see anything and it made everything appear depressing and dingy. When I was having an issue with my ATM card (I am from California, so note the time difference). I asked if they would give me a small cash advance on my credit card and they flatly refused! Unbelievable! I happen to own a boutique hotel in California and I cannot imagine treating a guest like this! I booked this trip as a special trip for my daughter's graduation present and NYC was great, but our experience at the hotel was not! Too Bad!"
Hudson Hotel,Sep 2 2008,Hudson Hotel was amazing!,"I just got back from NYC and stayed at the Hudson Hotel on W 58th and 8th Ave in Manhattan. It was a very chic hotel. I got it off the top 20 on Travelzoo for about $200 a night and thought it was a great value for the location and it being Labor Day weekend and the 10k Nike race that I was going too. The rooms were very small but hey, it's NYC. The actual grounds on the hotel was wonderful. The sky terrace on the 15th floor was right out of a Restoration Hardware catelog. I took a great nap in the hammock. The drinks were very expensive but worth the $20 to sip champagne in the lounge and feel like a star. The hallways were dimly lite and it was hard to see at times. But overall, the hotel was so cool and chic. I cna't wait to go back. The rooms are more on the romantic side than 2 girl friends staying the weekend but we didn't care. Next time, I am bringing a man though :) The shower had a glass that you could see into the bed area! But it had a curtain for privacy as well. I can't wait to stay again!"
Hudson Hotel,Sep 1 2008 ,Small Rooms Unique Lobby,"Pros:*Location~Right near central park and accross the street from the Time Warner Building..*Lobby~ Very unique, as you can see from the pictures*Roof Top Bar~Great atmosphere, comfy charis, couches, etc to lounge onCons:*Rooms~ Literally the size of a tiny boat cabin. Uncomfortable bed, The side glass wall of the shower is open up to the bed, so if you adventurous, just open the curtain and give him a show. *Boderline Obnoxious staff, not very helpful and a lot of cat-calling(except the bar tender in the library~he was great, talkative, and helpful)*Lighting~The lighting in the lobby is great. But in the hallways to the guestrooms...really? Honestly felt I was walking the halls of a seedy apartment, expecting a crack addict to pop out of the corner and jump me...We got this room for $169.00 per night for the end of summer promotion they were running. Honestly, if they charged much more, I would have asked for my money back, not impressed. For an extra $50.00 I would have stayed at the W, got plush bath robes, and a room I could actually walk in."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 1 2008 ,fancy but very small rooms,"Was looking to stay at this hotel for a few nights as my cousin was getting married and having his functions at this same hotel. The room itself is fancy if not very tiny even for NYC, i suppose i would recommend this property for anyone that was looking for someplace hip and convenient to central park. It is relatively pricey even when using priceline, though perhaps not since this is NYC during a busy month. The atmosphere is chic and the place was clean and adequately furnished."
Hudson Hotel,Sep 1 2008 ,New York Chic at its finest,"I loved this hotel - young, hip and friendly! Yes the rooms are small, but they represent capsule living very well, the furnishings are plush and stylish. The hotel has an excellent restaurant and fantastic bar - amazing to people watch! Really felt I was experiencing a true cosmopolitain New York and would stay here again in a heart-beat. Can't wait to go back!"
Hudson Hotel,Aug 30 2008 ,Terrible Service not worth the price,Stayed here with my friend in July as we was passing thru and had read some of the reviews we was a bit uncertain what to expect. Even if we had emaild and called to confirm our room type they still put us in the woring one with a dbl bed for to guys !!!! The front desk was most unhelpfull and no one was wearing nametags so when confronting them again there was no way to get hold of the first person.They said we had to pay for an upgrade even if we had got confirmation everything was okej so unpro.We finally got our hand on a manager and he was very unreluctant to help with the issue too.After a lot of back and forth they finally changed the room.Bu tI will never stay here again the rooms are very small and the prize to high
Hudson Hotel,Aug 28 2008,definitely dark...,"booked this through lastminute.com. I stayed twice in the same month, once with friends, once with family. Both times everyone remarked how dark it was. Front desk staff I thought were unjustifiably snooty but not so bad. If you don't have a cab driver who knows where the hotel is, you'll drive right past, no sign or anything. Rooms were small but hey we're Brits we were fine with that. Had cocktails in the bar when we arrived which was nice, busy but not overcrowded. Yes I'd go back I think.."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 27 2008,A business hotel this is NOT,"Very disappointed in this hotel. I'm very open to unique experiences, but this hotel fell flat on several key areas. 1) The best room in the hotel is called the Library. A great space, but closed for renovations. No notice when booking or on the website. 2) Promises a &quot;newspaper of choice upon request&quot; on the website. I requested a USA Today at check-in, but they did not deliver or have one in the morning at the front desk. 3) The size of the room is very small (take a 2-car garage and make 4 quadrants. Walk into 1 of thos quadrants - that's your space). The bed does not have a box spring, so it's very close to the floor. 5) The hallways are very dark, dull and a little scary when someone else passes you in the Hallway. 4) I paid $375 per night for 2 nights and later found out via hotels.com that I could have stayed at the Waldorf Astoria for the same price. If you're looking for a fun night out, definitely check this place out. It's happening. But stay somewhere else..."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 16 2008 ,Hip maybe enjoyable no,"The staff is friendly and efficient. The standard room is very small, even by New York standard. The safe is placed on the floor, which makes it uncomfortable to use it. The best part is the transparent glass window between room and bathroom, which enabled me to watch my wife having a shower. They pretend to be ecological conscious so they dim the light in the hallway to almost darkness which is neutralized by the noise of the soundamplifier in the bar. 30$ for glass of wine and a beer is hefty. Would I stay there again? Probably not."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 15 2008 ,Very stylish but not too good,"Went here on an extended business trip and first of all was taken by the modern and stylish reception area as well as the nice outside bar, which you would not expect in such a location. Very close to Central Park, Columbus Circle Tube and a short stroll to Fifth Avenue or Broadway. However, even that i was upgraded into a &quot;suite&quot; the room was still quite small and that they had a quick renovation of a former old style hotel into something which should be cutting-edge. Not fully completed the job here. Bed was very good and had a good sleep, but doors where so thin you could here everybody passing outside. Nice breakfast area and good atmosphere and buffet here. The hotel also has a terrace on the 15th floor where you can enjoy drinks with a view over Manhattan. Quite cool! Overall a kind of mixed experience. Generally very good but oversells itself and not too good value for money."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 13 2008,You can't go wrong!,"After reading some negative reviews I was apprehensive about staying at the Hudson Hotel in NY. Everything I read was true, there is no sign outside of the hotel, it is very dark, the rooms are very small and the food was very good. If you are planning to stay there or considering a stay - need not worry! I would absolutely stay there again. They had what's most important - clean, quiet rooms, courteous staff, and a great location: right across the street from a subway station and a block away from Central Park. Times Square is an easy walk as well as 5th Avenue and FAO Schwartz. When we first arrived, the room we were assigned smelled really strongly of smoke. The front desk happily changed rooms for us and the second one was impeccable. The rooms are very small. The TV was tiny, but nobody goes to NY to watch TV. The standard rooms consist of a bed and a tiny bathroom, but they were more than adequate for the two of us. They made good use of the small space with hooks and shelves in the bathroom. Speaking of the bathrooms – in pictures, the pane of glass in the shower I thought was a little revealing with no privacy, but they do actually have a curtain on each side of the glass which was a relief.The Hudson cafeteria had great food. The service was poor, and breakfast is over priced, but at least the food was good! The lounge seemed loud and happening, but once you got off the elevator it was peacefully quiet. Outside of 1,000 doors slamming loudly in the hallway every morning, you couldn't hear your neighbors or people roaming the halls. If I could give the hotel one suggestion for improvement it would be the bedding. No real mattress cover - just a &quot;throw&quot; under the sheets. The sheets weren't fitted either so they often came un-tucked during the night which was annoying. The beds themselves were comfortable enough, although very much like a futon. Overall, the room rates were a bit over priced, but what hotel isn't in NY? The front desk staff was accommodating. The lobby was beautiful. The rooms are clean and have great temperature control. Not to worry! You can't go wrong with the Hudson"
Hudson Hotel,Aug 13 2008 ,Beware the room size,"The Hudson is a stylish hotel situated very close to Central Park on 58th St. Extremely handy for Columbus Circle subway it is very easy to travel to most parts of the city from there. The hotel does not announce itself. The building's exteroir is very bland and does not even have it's name on the front. All the public areas in the Hudson are beautifully furnished and decorated. Having said that, I might be wrong as the reception areas were hardly lit in a 'trendy' way.Our stay was spoiled by the size of the room. It was minute with a postage stamped size bathroom to match. Barely big enough for one person let alone two, There was very little hanging space and no shelves or drawers. As a consequence, for our 3 night stay we had to leave our clothes in suitcases on the floor which restricted space even more. The air conditioning was the noisiest I have ever heard, and although we were on the 11th floor the noise from the street was constant. On the plus side the room's decor (similar to the public areas) was very nicely done in dark wood. When we tried to change our room all we were offered was a very expensive upgrade. If you do go to this hotel, ensure that you get a larger room."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 12 2008 ,Not worth the hype,"It wasn't a horrible experience, but I'm glad I didn't pay rack rate; my rate was $199 throughTravelzoo.com. The lobby decor does not strike me as modern, chic, hip, fun, etc. It's dark, and in the back of my head I couldn't help but think of how much you can hide by dimming the lights, using dark paneling, and painting the walls and ceilings grey. I didn't think the bar was particularly hip, chic, or fun, either. I visited the bar once, a glass of house wine cost me $14, and there was hardly anyone there. Basic room is not small, it's itty bitty. I'm only sleeping there, so I don't really care, but traveler's should be aware that the standard room is only about 9.5' x 9.5'. It barely fits a bed, with a 13&quot; TV inside the narrow cabinet. The wall that separates the bedroom from the bath is glass, obviously to give the illusion of more space. I (woman alone) was put in the last room at the very end of the hallway, which I understand is a no-no in the industry. My room's door frame was cracked, and the chain lock hung on by one screw ... not very secure. The door wouldn't latch properly right away because of the crack (looked like maybe someone tried to kick the door in), so I asked the front desk to send someone up to look at it. When I showed him the cracked door, he jotted it down in his notebook to make sure someone looked at it, but made no offer of a more secure room for me. Breakfast restaurant is another very dark room, and was absolutely freezing cold on the two March mornings that I ate there (quickly, as it was so cold I couldn't wait to leave).I just checked the Hudson website, and today's rack rate is about $499. That is just mind boggling to me! This hotel is so not worth it!"
Hudson Hotel,Aug 11 2008 ,could it get worse....yup,"This is for priceline too!I booked this hotel for 3 thru priceline at 250 a night. first night smoke smell in a non smoking room was unbelieveable, my cloths still stink that were in my luggage. My daughter (14) had to sleep on the floor because they would not give us a cot! Cool shower glass wall into the room so you can see in, did i mention 3 people. tv something for $50 at walmart. Second night they upgraded us to a queen deluxe for $60 more charged us for at cot too. The tv in this room was nice oh but it didn't work. they worked on it sevral times with no clue what they were doing. Food was average way over priced. two vodka martinis at the bar $36 (greygoose) a bottle cost $20, who do they think they are. Management was pleasent but did nothing to help they kept saying because i went thru priceline they couldn't do anything for me. Priceline was no help at all."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 10 2008 ,A must stay - fun hip hotel,"This hotel is a must stay if you like contemporary, unique, hip design. The rooms are very small but impeccably clean with high-end finishes. Great late night bar scene in Hudson Bar. Hotel appeal to young adults more than families."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 10 2008 ,Great Location Clean Rooms Had a Great Stay.,"My wife and I stayed at the Hudson for a week and had a great time. We were terrified by some of the reviews, but the hotel beat our expectations. Yes the rooms are small, but if you are under 50 and not to large yourself the rooms are fine. Everyone treated us great from check-in to check-out. The rooms are very clean, and you can not beat the location."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 9 2008 ,Pleasantly surprised,"My husband and I booked a last minute NYC getaway. We had 3 sets of show tickets and just wanted a clean place to stay in a decent neighborhood (we used to live in NY). I had never heard of the Hudson, but had read the reviews and checked out their website (which has a picture of the front of the hotel, which is unmarked, but lined with shrubs). You take an escalator up to the lobby, which is very cool and happening. At night, there is a raging party going on in the bar scene. The Hudson Cafeteria is on the lobby level, and you can eat outside in the adjoining terrace. The hotel is across the street from an upscale mall (Columbus Shops) that has several restaurants on the 3rd floor. As others have said, the room is very small, but the bed is good, and the space is adequate, especially if you're not planning to spend much time in the room. We got a rate of $200 (Name your own price on Priceline), which is very good for this location. We would definitely go back."
Hudson Hotel,Aug 7 2008 ,Great location with modern vibe,"Pros - Great location one block from Central Park and one block from the subway. This hotel has a young hip and modern vibe which can make you feel like part of the in crowd staying here. If you like the bar scene then this hotel has a big one right in the lobby plus an outdoor terrace that looked lovely in the photos - we unfortunately did not see it in person as it was closed during the times we thought to check it out. The front desk staff were helpful and seemed to enjoy their jobs.Cons - The public areas and hallways are very, very dark. Although it is part of the look they are going for it is somewhat annoying to not be able to see anything in the lobby unless you go stand under a lamp. Also the hotel has no name outside so you have to be lucky to get a cab driver that knows exactly where it is at. The rooms are tiny but unless you are staying at a $400 dollar a night hotel this is what you get in NYC. Finally the hallways and elevators are not air conditioned so by the time you get to your room you are sweating!We got a good price for this hotel via Priceline and I expected a small room in New York so the &quot;cons&quot; would not prevent me from recommending this hotel or staying here again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 26 2009 ,Amazing quiet hotel in the middle of everything!,"All the Westin associates were helpful and most pleasant. My room was wonderful as well. I booked this hotel for a small group of associates as the events planner for my company. My contacts ahead of time and staff at check in accomodated all my needs and any changes in reservations quickly and correctly. My room was quiet, the beds were amazing and my 4 night stay was great! I would stay here again any time."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 26 2009 ,Westin Times Square.,"It was beautiful! But no mini bar! Comfortable bed, hot shower, and we were very high up :)"
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 25 2009 ,An unexpected glorious experience,"This hotel is located about a block from Times Square and easy walking distance from many of the theaters. I was allowed to check in very early without requesting ahead of time. A very courteous bellman helped us to our room. The room was very clean and modern. The bed was, hands down, worth the price of the room. It is the most comfortable bed I think I have ever slept in. The room was also very quiet, even though we were there on Halloween night and things were kicking outside. The bathroom was also modern with good water pressure even on a high floor. The elevators seldom have a wait even though the hotel was pretty crowded and everyone leaves at the same time for dinner and shows. The check in and out process was very efficient, and there are always cabs waiting outside. This was an awesome experience, expensive but worth it in my opinion. My only caveat would be PLAN EARLY. I have tried to stay here before and the hotel has not had availablility on the dates that I wanted."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 25 2009 ,Location staff and amenitites were great!,"It is easy access to &amp; from the tunnel. Once you're there, you can walk or take the train to anything you want to see or do. Staff were very knowledgeable and helpful with getting around to see our list of &quot;to-dos&quot; . We will stay there again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 25 2009 ,Great Hotel wonderful helpful staff and rooms with breathtaking views.,"This a a great hotel if you want to stay in Times Square. It is centrally located to uptown and downtown to the village. The staff is so helpful and the rooms are are updated, comfortable and cozy."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 25 2009 ,Location Location Location!!!,"We loved the location and the ease of walking to theaters, shopping, finding Times Square, or grabbing a taxi.  The concierge were excellent in recommendations for dinner. They were also more than willing to take photos of our family and friends that visited us in the hotel lobby.The rooms were neat and cozy, a little too small for my taste, but we wern't there to spend time in the room. When we did, the flat screen TV was outstanding, and of course, enough can't be said about the &quot;Heavenly Bed&quot;."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 25 2009 ,Great location in the heart of Times Square,Great location for a theater weekend in NYC. Was able to check in earlier than the 3PM stated time. Nice rooms - larger than most NYC hotels.Concierge was very helpful with restaurants.
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 25 2009 ,More than I expected!!,"exceptional desk staff, courteous staff in general, very polite and willing to help. clean hotel, got my 4am wake up on time etc... greta at the front desk, very very helpful"
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 21 2009 ,Comfortable Functional ,"The room was of a good size, very comfy bed and the inclusion of an Apple Mac in the room was an unexpected bonus ($15/day internet connection though). You have a 1:4 chance of getting a room with the view of the air conditioning systems, which I think has a kind of New York charm about it. While the room was perfectly adequate, the bath tap dripped non stop and the stainless steel sink and fittings felt institutional rather than stylish. I felt the corridoors could do with some attention and redecoration, it was looking a bit shabby in places. Check in was like talking to an automaton, very quick and efficient but devoid of any emotion. All in all a great hotel if you like beige and prefer efficiency over a human touch and a welcoming feel."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 16 2009 ,Service is lacking,"Expect to wait a looong time for eveything - valet, security, room service and bell hop. Sigma Six these folks are not. The front desk was not helpful at check-in but conciegre was great. The rooms were clean albiet small. For Amex Platinum cardholders - know that this hotel does not accept the Starwood Gold upgrades."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 12 2009 ,Service not quite up to par,"Since I frequently travel East from the West Coast on over-night flights, I have checked into many hotels in NYC in the morning. I was surprised to be advised by the front desk that no rooms available on a Monday morning at 9am, even though the hotel was aware of my early flight arrival. I was told to come back at noon. Having slept for only 4 hrs on the plane and then having to go into the office in the afternoon, this was not welcome news. So, I waited in the lobby for a while. When I went back up to the desk at 10am one last time to check with another attendant, she said that she did have rooms available, but just not with king sized beds. When you arrive early in the morning, you really don't care what sized bed there is, as long as there is a bed. I know that the same room was available an hr earlier but the front desk man had just not thought outside of the box. That was annoying. Things were fine the first night. It was the second day that another bobble happened. The rooms do not have alarm clocks. While this I am sure is an effort to encourage stress free vacations, this is a business hotel. People need know what time it is and there was no clock at all in the room. I relied upon the front desk for wakeup calls. This was fine for the first day, but not the second day. They never called, and since I was not adjusted to East Coast time, I did not wake up until past 11 am, after my scheduled meeting just before checkout time. Luckily it was not after my flight time. I was so annoyed and late that I didn't have an opportunity to complain to the front desk. I would request an alarm clock next time and suggest bringing another one yourself in case they fail to provide one."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 11 2009 ,Great Weekend- Excellent position off Times Square,"Hotel was great, as expected. Perfect location within 2mins of Times Square so good for a tourist with little time, you are right at the heart of the City. No complaints, food in shula's great. The best caesar salad I have eaten! Would stay there again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 11 2009 ,Really not worth the money and their star rating!,"After a long flight to Newark and transfer to Manhattan arrived at the Westin New York Times Square. As a Starwood Platinum Member normally get upgrades to standard suites, but not at this hotel. The rates are way to high for the too small rooms in this hotel.As well as the executive lounge which had almost nothing to offer. The &quot;breakfast&quot; was nothing more than in a 2 star motel. The service was also not worth more than 2 stars, even in New York. The only good thing about the hotel is its location."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 9 2009 ,Fab Stay at the Westin,"Just returned from the Westin after a 4 night stay with my sister and daughter, this was a birthday treat. We were allocated a room on the 34th Floor which had fantastic views of the Hudson River also pretty quiet at night. Beds were so comfortable and room very clean. We found the staff to be very helpful with any enquiries we had. Bought a couple of cocktails in Bar 10 which were very expensive. Location was excellent for theatre and shopping and metro although we tended to walk everywhere. Found some nice places to eat in 9th Ave and not expensive. Went to see the Jersey Boys in the August Wilson Theatre and they were fab would reccomend this show. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone coming to New York and hope to visit again in the near future."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 8 2009 ,A desillusion...,"I stayed at the Westin Times Square with my son (31) for three days. We got the room thru Hotwire. For us it was a grear desillusion: it is not definitively a 4 star hotel but a 3 star maximum. The location is in the worst part of Times Square, near 8th Av. that is ugly and dirty, noisy and you only see ugly people around. The room is clean, but the bathroom is not at all from a 4 star hotel (plastic glasses, the shower is old fashioned, the decoration is poor).It was our 4th stay in NYC but this was the worst location of all. If you want to stay in a nice spot of NYC stay between 46th and Central Park, and between 6th and Lexington. Times Square is just to walk around for a while, not a place to stay specially if you choose the west of Broadway where the Westin is."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 6 2009 ,The Westin touch - NYC style,My husband took me to New York for my 30th Birthday. He is a Starwood Member so we were upgraded to a lovely corner room facing the Hudson River. Decor was very modern w/ a vintage edge. I loved the beds ((so comfy --- like all Westins)) .. Our room was very spacious. Great location - still in Times Square-- closer to E-Walk. We had a wonderful stay! The staff was super accommodating. They held our luggage for our later flight even after we checked out. The windows in this hotel are panoramic!!! Perfect after all your walking around the big city. We would definitely stay here in the future!!!!! Thanks WESTIN!
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 6 2009 ,Great location. Average for a high price.,"One way to evaluate is to write about a hotel a while after return , and to see what trace the place has left in memory. Nothing special about this one. It has left me with little interesting to remember. The room was rather large, both room and bathroom were clean. Nothing in the decoration that is worth mentioning. Just the number of TV channel was impressive. I did not like the lobby area or the conference facilities. Large but cold, and not stylish. The staff was not particularly nice (especially at reception). It is often the case , for what I have experienced, in these large NY hotels. The location is very good (43th and 8av), but there are many hotels in this area. I found the hotel expensive for the experience it offered me."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 6 2009 ,Great location - Expensive Room Service,"Stayed 2 nights pre-cruise. Hotel is in a fantastic location! We arrived from LGA via SuperShuttle so got to see a bit of the city on the drive in, including the naked cowboy!Check in was a breeze and being SPG Gold, received an upgrade to a corner room on 32nd floor. Booked using cash and points ($90 per night) so stay was quite affordable by NYC standards. As others have said, location is fab, close to Times Square, Theatres and the bus/metro. Starbucks downstairs was a big plus as was the street vendor outside selling dogs and kabobs! Our first night, we were tired from travelling all day and ordered room service. A burger, salad and smoothie was over $70 after $20+ was added in tax, gratuity and service charge - lesson learned. Ouch!On day 2 it was raining so stopped by the front desk to borrow (complimentary) umbrellas which were light blue with a swanky Westin design on them!All in all, a great time was had and this hotel is highly recommended."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 6 2009 ,good hotel perfect location,"Stayed in the Westin in October 09 for 7 nights. Room on the 31st floor facing the hudson. It was quieter than I'd expected at night. Hotel room was cleaned daily, service was good. Desk staff were very helpful. This hotel is ideally suited for Times Square and the whole city is easily accessed from the subway round the corner. Overall a clean smart hotel with friendly staff in a perfect location."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 6 2009 ,No Go if a Solo Traveller,"I stayed at the hotel for five nights from October 29 2009 having booked it as a holiday for two through a travel agents in January 2009. Unfortunately due to personal circumstances I had to go alone. When I checked in there were numerous questions about why I was travelling alone and that they might have to change the room ...excuse me..?? I have still paid for two people to travel and be in the hotel. I then had to pledge 150 dollars against a credit card just in case I used the hotel facilities etc. Got to my room and the incredible view I'd been told I would see was.......the top of air conditioning units. Room was nice though although nothing really to say about how much things cost i.e. Intranet, coffee, products in the bathroom. Due to the way I had been treated when I checked in I wasn't taking anything for granted that the coffee was free and the products were also. Went to the restaurant for an evening meal...guess what? single person shoved in the corner...hmmm...meal was good though but expensive. Next morning I went to speak to the checkin staff again and was helped by a very very helpful male member of staff. My faith was restored....for a moment...Everytime I left the hotel I would say good morning/afternoon/hello/goodbye to the Security/Porters on the ground floor. Not once did I get a response. I once asked for directions...what a mistake... I went in the bar one evening having been to the theatre, I waited for about ten minutes whilst the barman continued his conversation with some men who were sitting at the bar. He then served somebody else who had come in after me before serving me. I ordered room service one night. The meal was lovely. The next morning I left everything in my room as I'd been told to do. When I came back from my day out the table and left over food was outside my room.....some 15 hours after I had eaten. It was finally taken away about 8pm that evening which was 21 hours after I had finished. The corridor didn't smell very fresh..It was only on my last day that service improved. Very helpful in storing my luggage for me and two of the porters were very helpful in getting me a taxi to the airport...one even carrying my luggage for me to the next block.Good points: a very short walk from times square, very clean, bed was lovely and some of the staff extremely helpful. Great location if you want to go to see one of the many shows.Bad points: Seems not geared for the single traveller, not enough information, always felt as though I had to go back and ask questions and then it was a lottery if you got a member of staff who was in a good mood. Also with room service an automatic gratuity of 18% was added to the bill with it stating that it is distributed equally amongst the staff but you still had to tip the porter that brought it to the room Double whammy me thinks..Love New York but will stay somewhere else next time."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 5 2009 ,fantastic hotel fantastic staff !!,"a wonderful place to stay the staff went out of there way to make our stay the best ever, i have travelled to new york before but no other hotels live up to the westin! the rooms where fantasic and clean with great views. will stay again when visiting new york"
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 3 2009 ,Superb hotel; Superb location,"Stayed here on a family break with a couple of teenagers in October 2009. Absolutely superb location on the corner of 43rd Street and 8th Avenue in the heart of Theatreland and only 5 minutes walk from the noise, bustle and sensory overload of Times Sqaure. We booked our hotel as part of a package with flights from the UK so whilst the Westin might be more expensive than some other hotels in the area our total costs were not excessive compared to other packages we saw. We had a large room with two very comfortable Queen beds on the 37th floor with fantastic views west over the city and river. Our Travel Agent had told us it would be possible to put a rollaway bed into the room as well but the hotel told us this was not possible with the double Queen beds – not the hotel’s fault if our Travel Agent gives us duff info. Otherwise room well equipped with big flat-screen TV, nice sized en-suite, twin-headed shower, big walk in wardrobe (could have done with a few more coathangers though), mini-bar and refrigerators available on request. There was also a gym / spa in the hotel which we never used. All the staff we spoke to were friendly and helpful.The hotel bar and restaurant was a bit pricy ($32 for two G&amp;T’s – mind you they were excellent G&amp;T’s!!!) but several Starbucks and a multitude of large and small well-priced restaurants within a few blocks’ walking distance. Now I’ve never been a big fan of Starbucks in the UK but these were excellent and within a few days I was being recognised when I arrived to pick up our morning Lattes and muffins.The hotel is situated across the block from the NY Port Authority Bus Terminal with excellent bus and subway links. Times Square express subway station is 5 minutes walk away. On the occasions we used the subway we felt safe and found it clean and efficient with staff available to help us if our route-finding went off. The starting point for the city bus tours is just along 8th Avenue and there are yellow cabs constantly passing the front door of the hotel. Central Park, the Rockerfeller Centre and 5th Avenue are all within a 15 minute walk. Several places offer bicycle hire but unless you are a very experienced city cyclist it’s probably best to avoid unless doing it in certain areas such as Central Park, Battery Park or along the riverfronts. We cycled in Central Park for 2 hours – awesome. Top tips? Avoid the Empire State Building. Big queues and when you get to the top you have to look through wire mesh. Do the Top of the Rock (Rockerfeller Centre) instead – queues not as long but views as good and probably better as lower observation deck protected by safety glass and upper deck open. Try to time your visit for sunset for the best views. Shame the Chrysler Building partially obscured by some anonymous bank building. Then if it’s the right time of year join the city-folk ice-skating on the plaza below. Take in a show. The hotel is in the heart of Theatre Land. The TKTS discount booths are close by; alternatively head for your favoured box office. We saw Billy Elliott. Excellent.Remember to do the night city tour but don’t spend too long on the day tours – get off and walk.Cycle in Central ParkThe City Pass looks like good value – but only if you actually use it. We found we could get better deals on bus tours and couldn’t use it for our preferred boat excursions as it was no longer running (despite advertising at the pier saying it was). Also provided only basic entrance to the Natural History Museum and excluded the special exhibitions – something we did not realise until we got to their entrances. Visit FAO Schwartz to see the actual floor piano Tom Hanks played in the movie “Big”.Oh and take your Credit Card for 5th Avenue"
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 1 2009 ,Prime Location,"This hotel is in the perfect location! It is not facing Times Square, but walk up the street (same block) and you are in the heart of it all! We were able to walk everywhere; Central Park, Empire State Building, Grand Central Terminal, 5th Avenue, the Hudson Bay Piers, Theaters...it was perfect. You will need transportation if you want to visit the Soho area, as it is too far to walk.The hotel itself was clean, although our room was not vacuumed when we checked in. After letting someone on staff know, it was a matter of 15 minutes and housekeeping was there to vacuum and was very apologetic. During the four nights we spent the room was kept clean.It was a bit pricey, but you are paying for the location. Definately worth it to us."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 31 2009 ,Great location if you dont mind 'hectic'.,"We stayed here for 4 nights, with young children. Times Square is a 2 minute stroll along the street. Beds are very comfy. The bath was rather shallow but that could be a US thing. Breakfast downstairs is really good."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 30 2009 ,43rd floor views,"It was great, we stayed on the 43rd floor and had great views toward Times Square. The beds were extremely comfortable and the shower was amazing. The staff had a friendly attitude towards us and were very polite and helpful. Hotel is in a great location for access to Times Square and subways. 8th Avenue had lots of reasonably priced delis and restaurants and many souvenir shops."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 27 2009 ,Great Stay,"I stayed here for three nights and was in the lap of luxury. I was assigned a corner room with a nice view of the city and the Hudson River. The hotel is smack-dab in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Times Square so expect some street noise - even on the 16th floor! The room was very modern in style and the bathroom was very nice. The staff was friendly and helpful at every turn. I marked the hotel as a good value, though I was using Starwood points and dollars so the price was great."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 27 2009 ,Centrally located extremely pricey good hotel,We stayed here in June 2008 for a week and it was a great location. On the 11th floor we did not have much of a view as we faced old buildings. The room was modern and of an average size. The room service was very expensive but quite nice. The lobby bar was nice but again being in manhattan everything was extremely expensive. It was a special occasion when we stayed there but I would not pay that kind of money again for central manhattan.
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 25 2009 ,Very Nice,"Junior Suite on the 30th floor - city view unremarkable (turns out many buildings are tall - go figure). Room was large and clean. Asked for a fridge - got one a no cost. Bedding very comfortable. Bath very large and open. Short (as in none) on amenities - cotton swabs, shower cap, etc. The shower has two shower heads with a sign that says you can conserve water by only using one of them. Hah. No newspaper at door - though I did sometimes find one near the elevator. Speaking of the elevator - don't get near one as the &quot;ping&quot; to tell you which elevator to enter is very loud. The room safe was large enough for my large laptop, nice. No microwave. Location was great. On 8th Ave., front is on 43rd St and rear is on 42nd St. You can skip on one leg to two subway stations as they are soooo close. Go west to 9th Ave, head north for endless restaurant selection. Starbucks down on ground level in back (42nd St). Breakfast was pretty bad at Shula's - $50 for two - very oily eggs/home fries - service was great though. Didn't try the bar nor Shula's for dinner. Some reviewers commented the neighborhood wasn't that great. The hotel sits a block or two from times square so there are definately less pedestrian traffic near the front entrance - but still felt very safe. The back entrance has a lot more people as here (42 st) you find some restaurants and other attractions (wax museum, Ripley's, etc.). There wasn't a food store nearby but plenty of delis and pharmacies selling fruit, milk, etc. You can print your boarding pass in the business center for free. I prepaid my hotel bill (via Orbitz) but hotel still created a temporary charge on my credit card for about $850 for incidentals for a 5 night stay (they told me $150 but it appears they meant $150/night - although the math doesn't seem to work out). Taxi was about $35 to/from LGA and took about 30 to 40 minutes outside of rush hour."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 25 2009 ,Westin Experience,"The hotel was fantastic, stayed for seven days and never had a problem&gt;. Rooms were cleaned on a daily basis and the staff were very polite. It is also a prime location, and being on the 43rd floor the noise was limited. would recommend to anyone."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 19 2009 ,Never again,"My wife, eight week old son and I were in NYC for four nights and included a friend's wedding.Pretty much everthing I have to say about this hotel would be edited. Never again says it all. Fortunately this stay hasn't dampened our love affair with New York, and we would definitely come again and stay somewhere else.The highlight of the hotel was meeting Tony Dungy in an elevator on the Sunday - presumably he was on his way to the TV studio (NBC Sports I think) to set up for the NFL games that day.NYC is a great city. It definitley doesn't sleep and puts London to shame in that respect. Come on Boris, sort out the night time transportation system. Highlights included cupcakes from Magnolia in Bleecker Street, and Doyle and Doyle antique shop in Orchard street."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 17 2009 ,Great Location...Unbelievable Staff,"It's not your typical Westin...not all the frills usually associated with a Westin stay. No free internet access, but other than that little complaint I have to say its a great place to stay. You can't beat the location, on West 43rd, between 7th and 8th. Easy walk to anywhere in the city and easy access to the subway. Great views. And the staff..unbelievable, they will go out of their way to make your stay a memorable one. The Business Center is a pay as you go for internet access, but you can use it free if you need to print out boarding passes. The rooms could use some sprucing up here and there, but overall better than some hotel rooms in NYC for the money. the family enjoyed it, we had a great view from the 45th floor...the windows can be opened a little to let in some fresh air, which was nice. I would recommend this hotel in a heart beat."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 16 2009 ,Great Place To Sleep In a city That Doesn't,"Times Square is a very busy, congested area so creating a tranquil, calming oasis in the midst of it all is no little feat. The Westin is a perfect hotel for business. The staff is well trained and attentive, the rooms are spacious (by New York standards) and are outfitted with a large desk and high-speed internet. The gym is OK and room service is average. I often rotate among the Westin, The Marriott Marquis, The Hilton Times Square and the W Times Square. I'd give the Westin the top grade among these otherwise fine choices."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 15 2009 ,EXCELLENT HOTEL AND SERVICE,"Member from Scotlandwe took our time to choose our hotel and i think we chose very well at the Westin, the service was second to none from the waiters to security and reception, a special mention to the conceriege Melanie who made our stay extra special as it was my daughters birthday and a lovely birthday cake arrived in a silver platter, it was so kind and it was extra special to us..everything was just perfect from the lovely big room with 3 windows to the breakfast and the welcome we got when we arrived at the hotel..i cant recommend the hotel highly enough...and would return to it for definate again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 14 2009 ,Wonderful Stay!,"We loved this hotel. It was very clean, and with the deal we booked, we received free breakfast each morning! It was lovely. The bed was sooo comfy and the staff very pleasant. The only thing I disliked was the very, very dim lighting in the entry, but other than that...this is a wonderful place to stay!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 14 2009 ,Great Location Modern Hotel,"Stayed at the Westin Time Square for 3 nights in a good sized room with 2 double beds. Comfortable beds, modern bathroom, flatscreen tv, IPod docking station / alarm clock, and in-room coffee maker (could use something other than powdered creamer). Centrally located with 42nd Street subway just around the corner and numerous restaurants / bars 1 block over on 9th (walk North once you arrive). They allowed us to check in early and all of the staff was friendly and accommodating. Price was high but that was more a result of the time of year than anything. Would stay here over other comparably priced hotels in the area."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 13 2009 ,Good location decent rooms.,"Our family recently stayed at the Westin Times Square on SPG points. We had a two connecting rooms on the 34th floor. Incredible views of Empire State Bldg. and Times Square. Rooms 3437 &amp; 39. King bed and double bed rooms. While room size on king room is okay for NYC the double bed room is a little tight on space. Bathrooms are small with very little counter space, but fairly new updates obvious. They worked fine for a long weekend stay and we were not in rooms much anyway. Towels were a little worn and had holes in them and the shower curtain smelled bad. Beds were comfortable. They did come change curtain at our request. The location is really good. Corner of 8th and 43rd. Impressed with soundproof glass to keep city sounds out at night."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 12 2009 ,The staff was a great customer service extraordinary,"If you want to be in the MIDDLE OF IT ALL, this is the place to stay. Now there's truly no reason to review a hotel in NEW YORK CITY and comment about the price, as you pay a premium for location. But the bell hops, the front desk all really accomodating for a first time New York City traveler. Would I go there again, yes...would I personally pick a location a little more off the beaten path, yes as the hub bub was a bit too much for this small town girl."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 12 2009 ,Great location! Excellant comfort,"This Westin is located right out of the fray of 42nd Street, right where you want to be! Close to all the attractions without the glare of the lights!Rooms were lovely, great beds and very modern bathrooms."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 11 2009 ,Modern Convienient and Clean,"The staff was courteous. Check-in was smooth. We were not able to get an early check-in, so they held our bags. The room was clean and modern. It was small, but standard for NYC Times Square. We had a gorgeous view. Centrally located. Easy to reach the attractions and subway. The free workout room was great. It was nice to stay in a NYC hotel with elevators that fit more than 2 people comfortably and don't take 12 days to get to the floor. The only problem is that the teens used the fridge to store sodas they brought from the deli which is motion sensored. We explained at the desk and they removed the charges for using the in room snacks. I would go back tomorrow if I had the time. The rooms are pricey, but not for Times Square. We got a great deal here on Travelocity."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 11 2009 ,Great Hotel recommended,"Excellent location - 2 minute walk to Times Square, across the road from subway and easy walking distance of restaurant district. I had the best sleep ever in a hotel, the bed was very comfortable and no noise in the hotel or from the outside (we were on floor 28). We thought room was spacious after reading most reviews of NY hotel rooms. Only gripe was that they had powdered milk for the coffee, even UHT would have been better, still great coffee from deli across from the entrance.If travelling from Newark Liberty would recommend the Airport Express bus $25 return each. It drops you off opposite the hotel at Port Authority, tickets can be purchased on the bus or from the info desk at baggage reclaim.Will stay here again when we return."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 8 2009 ,Nice hotel near but not in Times Square,If you're compelled (or want) to be in Times Square the Westin is within a block but it feels more removed from the noise and confusion of the immediate streets of Times Square. The rooms are nice and comfortable. Bed was especially comfortable.
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 8 2009 ,GREAT HOTEL-IN CENTER OF EVERYTHING,"Hotel was clean, spacious. We expected it to be a tiny room given the city and its location. It wasn't, it was close to many activitites and GREAT restaurants. Would definitely go back!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 8 2009 ,Great Location,"The Westin was very comfy and centrally located. It's a block away from Times Square but tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square. The rooms was large and clean. No view though, but we didn't care as we only really slept there and didn't do much else. The amenities were great too! It's a bit pricey but shop around online to find a good deal."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 8 2009 ,Excellent staff,"Great staff, close to Times Square, overpriced even with beakfast included."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 7 2009 ,Service ,"The hotel is in a perfect location - very central without being directly in Times Square. It is close to 9th Avenue which is exploding with wonderful restaurants and bars that are outside of the usual tourist traps. I was especially pleased with the service. I was able to get into my room extra early on arrival day and throughout my two night stay, the front desk folks were extremely helpful and pleasant. One morning the news stand in the hotel was closed so I asked where I could buy a newspaper outside the hotel. Immediately the security/bellman (?) took me back up to the front desk, disappeared for a moment and then handed me a NYTs - and even refused to accept payment. The room itself had a gorgeous view of the River. Definitely a great place to stay for either business or pleasure."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 7 2009 ,No Big Deal in Big Apple - Poor Location,"If you want to be in the middle of New York's touchy Times Square area, with it's associated street trash and crowds, this is your hotel.But given the many other more desirable locations in the city, this Westin might not be the best if you are going to step out on the street.First of all, it is NOT on Times Square. Surprise! Like the Florida hotels that say they are &quot;on the beach&quot; and are actually blocks from the ocean, this hotel is a couple of blocks removed from Times Square, not that it makes any difference, because its on a corner, jammed in among such neat little attractions as The Cheetah Strip joint next door and dozens of Eighth Avenue slop shops. In true NYC Hotel fashion, the ground floor is nothing but a security stop with escalators taking you up one level to check in and restaurant. This helps keep the local riff raff at bay, but can make finding the hotel tricky, even if you are an old New York hand. I walked the 10 blocks from Penn Station, thinking of Times Square and then stumbled around looking for the hotel that wasn't there. Poorly marked, this is a place even some cab drivers don't know about.The room was, as is so often the case in NYC, smaller than I would like and the W minimalist decor was fine, but the bath had a small stainless steel sink, (a la federal prison design), with very little available counter space. I have stayed in lots of less expensive hotels with more work space in the bathroom. The desk top area in the room had a glass top and plenty of work space though and excellent electrical access for our multiple chargers and computers. This is a fine feature and I wish more hotels provided such.WIFI costs $15 a day which, given the rates, should be free. Room coffee was Starbucks, a nice touch in a time when the Starbucks stores are serving instant coffee!!!Double headed shower in the bath was nice.Quiet room except for the inevitable doors slamming in the corridor.Window view had a nice over the roof tops view of Empire State building.Staff polite and accommodating.I'd give this hotel a 7 or 8 on my scale.If you need theater district access, it is probably fine, but I would seek better deals in a different location if I were making the selection at these prices."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 6 2009 ,Great hotel Great location,"I got a really great deal via Priceline for Oct 2 and 3. The hotel is right across from a subway entrance which is how I got to the hotel from the train. I had a quick check in - I was able to get into my room at 11 am- and had a room on the 24th floor. It was a good size, nice bed, lots of pillows, nice, large bathroom. It was quiet- no noise from neighbors, the maid came in more than once a day to straighten up(besides cleaning the room) and the concierge was very helpful."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 5 2009 ,No International TV but lots of TV Pornography,Now returned from our annual month's vacation in the US &amp; Canada. We stayed at the Westin in Boston in 2007 and this year at Times Square NY. Nice hotels but 2 interesting observations - 1. Never pay their prices if you want/need internet better to use Starbucks or cheap Holiday Inns 2. No recognition of 20 to 50% of the clients being non US and no TV from outside US - plenty of Pornographic TV for those interested.Is this a comment on your visitors or the hotel group's accountants?
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 3 2009 ,Great location but we may not return,"The Westin is in a great location for proximity to Times Square, subway stops, and many Manhattan locations are within walking distance. Unfortunately having said that the hotel fell short in many respects for us. First of all, our reservation requested no down pillows and comforters, which were in the room on arrival. When we asked that they be removed the maid pulled the comforter, and left the bed in shambles. The rest of the room was only partially cleaned, that day leaving us without coffee, towels, or the bed pillows requested to replace the down. Next was a leaking, dripping shower head that also squirted water to the side when turned on. It took two days of daily requests to get this repaired. The staff that we had contact with were all pleasant and professional, but it seemed that their communication between departments was lacking.  We used Starwood points for our stay at the Westin, and couldn't help but wonder if that had something to do with the service we received. Westin is usually one of our hotel choices, but this may be one will will avoid in the future."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 29 2009 ,Reception lady saved my life!,My company should have booked a room for me before my arrival but they did not. I learned that when I arrived to the hotel after 11 hour flight. I was exhausted. The young lady at the reception saw my shape and decided to divide a large suit to 2 rooms. I never forget what she did for me.
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 29 2009 ,Good for Free!,"We stayed here on points. As many have pointed out, you don't get the usual amenities from Starwood. That begs the question, why all the hype about being Gold/Platnum, if the service is not universal. How much does it cost to provide a bottle of water to your most valuable guests? Why don't I have a paper delivered to my door, as I do at 99% of all Starwoods? Oh yeah, and no club either.I would not pay the high price to stay here, and be treated like someone off the street.On to our stay. Check in was pleasant and smooth. We were given a nice room high up away from the noise.We had some issues on getting extra coffee,turndown service, and towels, but overall a good stay. great location for plays and shows, which was why we were there.Times Square is a tourist trap so pass thru quickly! Last, we orderd a limo for the trip to LGA, and it was the same as a dumpy taxi. Nice and clean, smooth ride. We used Carmel. $33, plus toll and tip."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 28 2009 ,Great location,"We were on the 39th floor, in a corner room - great views of the river and surrounding buildings.We couldn't have asked for a better location - it's 2 minutes on foot to the Port Authority, 4 minutes to Times Square and the Theatre District, 30 seconds to the nearest metro station and it's surrounded by loads of places to eat.Do bring your laptop if you're planning on using a computer at all - the business center charges $0.50 per minute. I believe each room has free internet; ours did.Room service is speedy and the staff is kind and efficient.Our only complaints:1. Unventilated bathroom: It didn't have a fan and the window was a showcase window so no air circulated and it smelled a bit fishy each time we came into the room. Suggestion: replace all bathroom windows with the click-open windows that are in the rooms.2. Old bed: It was obvious that legions of guests had sat up in bed while eating or watching TV, so the section of the bed where one's shoulders and back rest was sunken and lumpy. It was rather difficult to get a good night's sleep on such an old bed - it's clear it stopped being a Heavenly bed years ago. Suggestion: lie on the beds regularly and replace them immediately if they don't meet Heavenly standards."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 27 2009 ,Large slick and did I mention expensive?,"I stayed at the Westin Times Square for two nights this weekend, because a friend who is a Starwood Preferred Guest was able to let us use a promotional deal they had, so we booked a last minute stay at this ~$500/night hotel for free. We live in Connecticut, thus almost never get to stay overnight in the city due to the cost of it, and the close proximity of our home so we thought what did we have to lose? We arrived Friday night. The hotel is located on 43rd street at 8th avenue, a block off the center of Times Square. Everything you need is conveniently located, and even if you want some less touristy dining options, simply walk away from Times Square, over to 9th avenue and head north, and you will be presented with cuisine of every type without the tourist traps. I dine in this neighborhood often when coming to the city. Even so, I didn't like the location of this hotel being that I was not in NYC as a gawking tourist, and there are just too many people in this area which not only includes Times Square and all the theaters, but also a gigantic subway station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal. This is not the type of hotel you could very easily drive a car up to the front of, and drop people off although if you're staying in this particular touristy location of the city, you probably aren't driving anyway.Check-in was quick, and nothing out of the ordinary. From the expansive mezzanine-level lobby, we were whisked in a surprisingly fast and clean elevator up to the 26th floor where our room was. The hotel has, however, a total of 45 floors to give you an idea of the size. We had a standard king room, with a view facing north. Not the prettiest view in NYC, but could certainly be much worse- I'm not complaining. The room is not decorated with much, and the decor is of a modern mid-century revival style, as is the entire hotel. The room was very clean, and everything appeared to work as it should, including the iPod radio. The TV was attractive, and worked, but the channels which were supposed to be HD did not appear very sharp at all. There was a small closet, a safe, and a stocked mini-fridge with the usual fiendishly overpriced candy, soda, water, and alcoholic beverages. A quick glance of the price list told me that a can of Bud was about $8, and wine was $25, and I can't comment on the rest of the items since I stopped looking at that point. Other than the price, I'll have another word on why not to touch the mini fridge at the end. A nice feature of the hotel is that the tilt-style window opens a few inches if you want to let in some fresh air. Even with the window open, there wasn't a terrible amount of noise for being in Midtown, due to the room being on the 26th floor. The bathroom, decorated with nice dark grey stone tile and white textured wallpaper, was very clean as well and very large too- it was at this point that I discovered that our room was a disabled-access room, which leads to my main gripe about the place. The shower was a pretty large walk-in style with hand rails, and a removable shower head on a hose as would be in any ADA compliant bathroom and not the &quot;twin-type&quot; as seen in many pictures on this site. My first issue with the room came when I went to take a shower the next morning, and found the water pressure seriously lacking. My fiancee also found it irritating, as it was extra-difficult to rinse out her hair. My second gripe about the layout of the handicapped bathroom, was that the rack for the towels was on the opposite wall from the shower, so once finished, I couldn't reach out of the shower and grab one. I had to exit the shower and lean over to the towel rack. Not a huge deal, but annoying nonetheless. My third and final gripe about the bathroom is the biggest. The sink was a very small unit attached to the wall, and not built into any sort of counter top. There is only a small amount of space at the back of the sink to place a few items, so there is almost no place at ALL to put anything in the bathroom. I actually had to hang my toiletries bag from a towel hook, as there was no other place in the bathroom to put it. Again, this is obviously a fault of having the handicapped accessible bathroom, as it appears this does not apply to the standard rooms from other traveler's photos. The bed was appointed with several layers of sheets and quilts which all felt pretty high quality, and 4 large pillows plus one little decorative pillow. While the bed wasn't bad and not even close to the worst one I've stayed in, I found it a tad hard for a hotel of this price. I've stayed in better beds at places a third of the price of this hotel, although those hotels were not in New York City. All in all, I slept pretty well, and the room was very quiet. This part of my review leads me to comment on how expensive the food is. In our room was a tag you could put on your door with a list of items available to order for breakfast in your room. Typical breakfast fare presented itself at prices only suitable for business travelers or people with more money than sense. Mere cereal is $12, a glass of milk $5, fruit and yogurt is $10, and a coffee is $8. Needless to say, we did not partake in hotel room service, and walked around the corner for bagles. Since we were staying there under a &quot;Starwood Preferred Guest&quot; account, we were given a canvas tote bag at check-in which had some soaps, mints, and some papers advertising various hotel stuff mostly pertaining to business traveler stuff that would probably interest someone who actually was a Starwood Preferred Guest. Of notable interest, was a memo from the hotel stating that we were invited to an &quot;Unwind Session&quot; at Bar 10, the hotel cocktail lounge in the lobby. We partook of this saturday evening and found it quite good, although we were quite glad we weren't paying for it. Our freebie entitled us to 4 beers, and an appetizer selected from a list of three or four. We selected the sirloin beef sliders, and had four Sam Adams Boston Lagers. The beer tasted fresh, and the sliders were tasty, although there were only three of them and among two people that doesn't amount to much. The beers I seem to recall were listed around $8 which is a terrible price for a beer of a common sort, and the sliders were something atrocious like $17. But for us, free tasted good. Another gripe that tells me this place is geared towards business travelers, is that the wireless internet in the room is not free, or at least it did say I had to pay on the little connection screen I got on my iPhone when I tried to access it. $15 for one day of internet. Come on Westin! The days of charging people for WiFi are over. I can get free internet at a Red Roof Inn that I spent $50 a night on! At $500 a night, I should expect some bandwidth. This morning, on Sunday, we went downstairs to check out. Nothing out of the ordinary about this process, other than the fact that they asked us if we had consumed any of the items in the mini fridge with the high roller-priced items inside. Although we did store some leftover food in the fridge, we didn't eat any of the items, and later learned that even if you TOUCH some of the items in there, they can try and charge you for them as there are sensors of some sort which apparently aid in the billing of these items. We had inadvertently &quot;consumed&quot; over $30 of mini-fridge goodness on our bill, but once we explained that we had not, having the charges removed was no hassle at all. So in conclusion, would I say this is a nice place, and did I enjoy my stay? Of course. Did I like the location? No way- too touristy, and crowded.Would I stay here again? Probably not, but then again I'm not likely to spend this much money on a hotel in New York City anyway, and like I said our stay was complimentary.I'd recommend this hotel for a couple or business travelers, but not a family and certainly not someone looking for budget accommodations. Oh and be sure to specifically ask NOT to get the handicapped accessible room."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 27 2009 ,Great Location Very Good Service Comfortable stay,"My husband and I spent 10 nights here on our recent first visit to NY. And I have to say that even though we were a bit put off by some negative reviews, we really had to struggle to find fault with this hotel. I will start with the negatives first:1. The hotel is expensive (although we did not spend any of our money there because we had a $500 credit to use on food and beerage as a courtesy form Virgin Holidays as the hotel closed the club lounge) BUT so are most hotels in NY. What else do you expect right? A glass of champagne - $20; in house breakfast for 1 was $40 and just OK. A lunch meal and a few drinks (maybe 4 drinks or so) came up to about $120. Of course you do not have to eat at the hotel because there are loads of cheaper places around. Like I said we had a complimentary stipend to spend and we made the most of it.2. The room was a bit dim with ok views (38th floor) but still very comfortable to return to for the 10 nights we were there. In fact even the elevator was very dark and you struggled to see very well in there.3. Be careful when moving around the drinks in the fridge and putting your own in there as the charges are automatically calculated based on weights. We were a bit surprised at the bill and when we queried it further, we got them to remove all the charges for the items that we did not use form the fridge.For us those were the only faults we could find with the hotel. Overall staff were always very polite with us. We spent a lot of time in the Shula's restaurant and bar downstairs mingling with staff and were always treated well (special mention of the friendly Jody). Regarding the food itself at Shula's, the quality was excellent and the portions were just right. We also returned in the wee hours in the morning from heading out into Greenwich village and the staff would still be friendly and welcoming.On the location, you cannot ask more of the hotel for being one block from the lively Times Square, Theatre District, some good restaurants in Hell's Kitchen and the subway (42nd street).I would certainly return to the Westin or any starwood hotel for that matter."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 25 2009 ,Just average,"I was very disappointed with my stay @ westin times square. Being a westin, i expected it to have a semi-luxurious feel to it but the hotel is old. Being a platinum member, I thought we'd get upgraded but it wasn't the case. No extra water in the room so we got some from store nearby but when you're spending at the hotel and have stayed there for a while you expect certain a higher level of service.I think the location of Times square is a bit too touristy. Most of the nice restaurants are away from the area so union square or soho would probably make a better location with more character."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 23 2009 ,Shocking,"Only stayed here because Fashion Week was on, and most other hotels either full or very expensive. This was still 450 a night before taxes. Check-in was fine, friendly staff. Room was big. City view totally misleading - even on a high floor couldnt see a single NY landmark. Recently renovated a joke - define recent? Scuffed wall, damaged lamps, peeling wall paper. Bathroom tiling like something from a pub toilet. Sheets torn, if they were changed at all. Had to get them to change one set due to a bloodstain. No amenities whatsover. TV nice, when it worked. A lot of stations too fuzzy to watch. Good location yes, and friendly staff. I spoke with manager and he offered to change rooms but that is more hassle for the traveller than the hotel. I had to leave for one night and check back in. Second room even worse. Blind broken, would not go up or down. Not that it mattered as window was so dirty. Then when i tried to ring front desk the Service Plus button didnt work! At that point i'd had enough and left. The property is no where near a 4* hotel."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 23 2009 ,Great place great location,"How tough is it to pick a hotel in NYC!? Very tough I would say, there's so much choice. After lots of research we chose the Westin Times Square mainly for the location. We were not dissapointed, the hotel is very good. It's a big place, but you don't really have that feeling when you enter it (which is a good thing I would say). Pay a bit extra for a room at the higher floors so the outside noise won't bother you so much. The room was clean and quite spacious, the bed was comfortable."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 22 2009 ,Fab hotel in a fab city,"We stayed here for one week in August. First impressions of this hotel were excellent, the staff were very polite and helpful. The lady at check in was very friendly she gave us a room on the 38th floor which we were very pleased with, we could see the Empire state building which was great! Our room was a good size plenty of room for the three of us. The beds were lovely and comfortable especially after a long day walking around the city.We were very happy with our room, it was always cleaned to a high standard when we returned after a long day.We used the resturant for breakfast one day and for lunch another day, the food was absolutely gorgeous, and the staff were very attentive.The location of the Westin is fantastic, we were near lots of great resturants, and shops.Also not too far to walk to many attractions.I would recomend this hotel it was fab!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 13 2009 ,Couldn't pick a better location,"I have recently returned from a 4 night stay at the Westin at Times Square. We arrived earlier than the stated check in time but had no problem getting our room and check in was very easy. We were offered a city or river view and chose the river view which was lovely. We had a twin room which was a good size, had plenty of storage space and a decent sized bathroom. The beds were the best I've ever slept in and greatly appreciated after a long day walking the streets of New York. We were 1 block from Times Square and within walking distance of all the main attractions, therefore only used a cab in the evening for dinner reservations that we had made. I would recommend this hotel not only for the superb location but for the standard of room and the service we received during our stay."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 12 2009 ,Very good midtown hotel.,"We had a very good stay at the Westin, the location is excellent and so close to all the major tourist attractions. Room was a good size and we had a very nice view, Staff are friendly and helpful and check in/out were very quick and efficient. Staineless steel washing hand basin in bathroom is a bit tacky and we found the pillows very flat. Apart from those minor issues everything else was very good. When we are back in New York we will try another hotel but this is no relfelction on the Westin it just that we love stayi g in different gotels every time we travel."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 11 2009 ,Great second stay at the Westin,"Stayed here two years ago. It was so good we didn't think it could happen again, but it did! Fabulous high floor corner view room with windows that open a little. Location is great. Right next to Times Square, but adjacent to residential and local businesses. A friend lives a few blocks from the hotel in what seems to be a totally different part of town. Easy walk (20 mins) to Central Park and midtown shopping and sights. The staff is very helpful and friendly, especially considering what a large hotel this is. Our son and his girlfriend had a room on a lower floor. Not the great view, but a good value and very comfortable room."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 9 2009 ,Great Central Location to Activities/Eating,"We stayed at the Westin Times Square over a long Labor Day weekend. This hotel is centrally located - close to all our tours, the subway, restaurants, etc. We enjoyed our stay. Our room was on the 25th floor. You could hear some car honking and some street noise - but nothing that kept us awake at night. We had a corner room and it was big by NYC standards. It was always clean and very convenient. The Westin Times Square is located one block from the busy central Times Square location - so you have a chance to avoid a lot of the crowds if you choose. We ventured there for some &quot;people watching&quot; but mostly stayed away.The hotel is just a couple blocks away from most of the tour companies we took (Gray Line, On Location Tours, etc. We were able to walk to the starting point for all these easily - within 5-10 blocks at most. For good non-chain restaurants, we walked one block west to 9th and there are a lot of great restaurants within an easy walking distance. My cousin lives in town and pointed us over there for good food at a decent price.Overall, we had a great stay and would recommend this hotel for it's location and convenience."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 8 2009 ,Perfect Stay!,"I was a bit worried after reading some of the negative reviews but was very pleased with our stay. We booked our rooms on hotwire and got a great rate. The hotel was perfect for us, centerally located, great rooms, nice views and perfect service. Would happily stay at this hotel again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 7 2009,Not What Expected By A Westin,When we arrived at the hotel we waited atleast 30 minuets to get valet to take our car. When we got into our room it was just simple. Then we relized the the chain of our room looked like someone tried to pull it off! &quot; The Westin Heavenly Bath&quot; was certainly not &quot; Heavenly&quot;! It reminded me of a airplane bathroom! Plus the veiw was terrible! We overlooked a rooftop with heaters! We orderd room service and it took a long time so we called room service to ask them why it was taken so long and they said&quot; We never got your order!&quot; 30 minuets later they came up with the food and it was pretty good but way overpriced! We couldove gone out for a nice dinner in the city! This hotel wasn't at all what we expected from a Westin.
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 6 2009 ,Great Location Nice Hotel,"Stayed here for a weekend trip to NY, hotel is in a great location, staff were helpful and polite. I would stay here again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 6 2009 ,WOW!,Really enjoyed my stay here. Location is wonderful - right in Times Square with all the NYC attractions. Rooms were large with great views. Amenities above average.
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 5 2009 ,Great Stay,Highly recommend this hotel. very friendly check-in staff .super clean rooms and comfortable beds.location is excellent .pax next door is great for breakfast
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 2 2009 ,Good hotel but DON'T TOUCH THE PHONE!,"Excellent location. Not a really grand entrance for such a large 4* hotel. Quite dark inside - this extends into the rooms and from what I read in reviews before I went, others have noticed this too. Is the Westin trying to save money by using low wattage bulbs?Bed was the best I ever slept in. Shower excellent also. Large LCD TV nice touch. I had asked for low floor due to fear of heights - ended up on 10th - bearable but would'nt have wanted to go much higher. Didn't eat here after noticing $12 for cornflakes! Go out onto the street eg. Brooklyn Diner @ Times Square for much better value. You really can't go wrong for food no matter where you eat in New York actually.Only gripe was that on arriving, used phone in room to call home to N.Ireland and check on kids. The call was no more than 5mins. You can check your account for your stay on your TV. It cost over $53 inc. tax for this call. After raising my annoyance with reception, they cut the bill by 50% as a goodwill gesture. Still extortionate though. Go outside (again) and buy a phone card but do not use this with the room phone, use a public phone on the street - massively cheaper.All in all a very nice hotel although the reception staff can be dismissive if you question anything. I actually won this holiday and would probably not pay this much to basically sleep for the night (as we were out from morning to night sightseeing). I would have went 3* but hey, if you can afford it........"
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 2 2009 ,Superb Hotel,"We stayed at the Westin 27th August to 1st Sept after having booked a great deal through British Airways. I have to say having read various reviews of the hotel prior to travelling, i was a little apprehensive. All i will say is, i found the entire experience fantastic.I booked a delux room at a little extra cost, and if you get the option, go for it. What a room. It was on the 41st floor and had spectacular views of downtown New York. Could see the Hudson on one side and the Empire State building on the other. The room was very big, especially for New York. I have stayed at another relatively large hotel in Times Square and the room was tiny.I was very suprised about the room, the flat screen TV is also large with HD channels and the king size bed was just luxurious, especially after them long days walking around the city. Also in the room worth noting was the lovely morning smell of 'Starbucks' coffee from your very own coffee maker. The bathroom was very nice too with loads of towels and plenty of space, very modern and decked out to a high standard.We took our ipod and took advantage of the docking station provided on the bedside cabinet, sorry to our neighbours if we made too much noise.....Also, on each floor there is a large Ice machine and in our case, was almost directly outside our room. Its in its own room so noise is kept to a minimum, this was very handy for us and we used it each night for our water etc.The reception staff at the Westin were excellent. Couldn't do enough for us. They made telephone calls for us to arrange our return collection to JFK at no cost and also helped us check -in on line for our return flight home. This was very usefull, as BA only allow seats to be booked either on-line 24hrs before the flight or once you're at the airport, so in oreder to get the seats you want, make sure you book early to avoid dissapointment.They asked each day if all was well and even though we arrived at 3pm Thursday, i never saw any queues there, except for the 'Starwood' contingent who seem to complain about everything. We used the hotel bar late on an evening which was really nice, not cheap but hey its a 5* hotel in the centre of town.Just around the corner after the Milford Plaza and directly opposite the Majestic Theatre where 'Phantom' is, is John's. Its a Pizza restaurant which is massive inside and comes highly recommended, but remember to order just one pizza between you, they are huge !Something which we booked prior to flying out to NYC was the 'City Pass'. We booked this through VIATOR and saved loads and loads on the cost of individual tickets. Oh and you get to go to the front of the queues in some places.All in all, i would certainly return to the Westin on times Square, it was an excellent hotel and comes highly recommended."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 1 2009 ,great hotel awesome location!!!,this is a beautiful hotel. it is centrally located and the service is great and the room is clean.
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 31 2009 ,Could be much better,"I've stayed at this Westin on at least 4 occasions for business and leisure. And, I am frequently disappointed by this Westin.If you want to be in Times Square, it's convenient, and many rooms have nice views of the city. However, the overall experience leaves much to be desired. The staff at reception are often unfriendly (if not plain rude). There are almost always long lines to check in at the desk, and they rarely provide access to your room before official check-in time. In addition, rooms are not always very clean, and I had to ask housekeeping to finish the bathroom which had been left half-cleaned!There is an additional charge to use the fitness center; it seems they're often servicing the escalators; and most importantly, the rooms should be cleaner and fresher looking. All in all, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 31 2009 ,A great place if you get a good price...,"Stayed overnight to play around in the city. I got a great rate on Priceline, but I think I would have been less than satisfied if I had paid the going rates. I thought the lobby was a tiny bit shabby for the rating. Our room was great and the best part was that it was very very quiet. It was a nice starting point for Times Square, The Garment District, The MOMA, and Lincoln Center. I'd go back if I got a good deal."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 28 2009 ,Never Again!,I stayed at the Westin in July. It was my first trip to New York and frinds had stayed here before (5 years ago!)and said how great it was.It is a great location but the service from reception staff was appalling - they were rude and unhelpful. Our room wasn't cleaned on the 1st day and I had to go and request for this to be done and get clean towels.Our room was advertised as newly renovated but it defintiely wasn't. the wallpaper was all marked and the bathroom was not 'heavenly.' The beds were comfy and Shula's was good but that's about it.This hotel is overpriced and I wouldn't stay there again. I always stay in expensive hotels but felt ripped off by this one!
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 28 2009 ,Perfect Location - quiet space near Times Square,"A great location and although it was right on Times Square, it was quiet in our room. Staff was very helpful."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 27 2009 ,A first and not a lst time,"A recent trip to NYC saw us taking advantage of a very good rate from &quot;Hotwire&quot; and booking the Westin. A fantastic hotel in a superb Midtown location. Close enough to everything. i rand a couple of weeks earlier to give them my SPG number and although we stayed at numerous SPG propeties within the USA the Westin NYC said they would not be crediting any points to my SPG account as we booked through &quot;Hotwire&quot;. This is wrong and I will be following up on this. This proved to be only one of a few faults of a really nice hotel. Upon check-in we were upgraded to a corner king and I thought this was quite special as we were staying the Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. The conceirge was a great help and gave us valuable help when it came to sourcing some great &quot;Yankee&quot; tickets, although I ended up booking online the help was much appreciated. On the other hand the in-house tour desk was not so good. we booked a fast boat ride of the staue of Liberty only to arrive and find out that these tours were cancelled that day due to the helicopter crash on the Hudson. i don't blame them for this but I would have thought a private tour company working within the Westin would be more switched on and the westin should monitor their service.Sorry for the tangent but I didn't want to forget. The rooms were clean, spacious and in good order, especially for NYC. the rate we received simply made a great hotel even better.Very professional outfit and would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to NYC."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 26 2009 ,A brilliant hotel,"I don’t know what some of the other travelers are talking about this hotel not being clean! This is a super hotel, in a great location, one block off Times Square. We took the express bus from the airport to the Port Authority, around the corner from the hotel, for $22 return. A big saving on taxis It took 30 minutes. at 9am. We arrived with our two children (7&amp;11) for a weeks stay, and were upgraded to room on 36 floor with great views of the Hudson River. The air-conditioned room was spacious and clean, with iron, hair dryer, tv etc. The two large twin beds were ‘heavenly’ as advertised and a real godsend after a long days walking, in the summer heat.The staff were friendly, extremely helpful, polite, and courteous.I would definitely recommend this hotel to others, and would not hesitate to stay there again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 24 2009 ,Customer Service came through,"I posted the review, &quot;Nice staff, but this hotel is simply not clean.&quot; After several attempts to get a response beyond a form letter from corporate, the general manager's office at this location has agreed to refund me the cost of my stay which is absolutely wonderful and deeply appreciated. The money is important, but it's the willingness to take responsibility that really changes my attitude. Thank you, Westin Times Square."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 20 2009 ,Location Location Location,"As the title says, the location was great. Easy walk to virtually everywhere and a subway station just across the street. The lights of times square were a stones throw away.Travelled with my wife and teenaged boys. We were upgraded to a club floor which was a large room with a Mac computer. (Great for searching restaurants). The lobby and room were fine. Service was excellent. Never used the gym. Never ate in the hotel because Shula's (even for breakfast) is overpriced. Lots of great breakfast places around.Concierge was lacking. The rates for a car to Laguardia and Yankee tickets were ridiculous. Would stay here again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 16 2009 ,A lovely stay,The Westin was in a convenient location for me. The only complaint was the registration process. They did not have enough staff for a Friday evening. Only 2 employees were registering guests and one of them walked away and disappeared. The room was very nice. The massage chair was a novelty but we didn't use it. The bed was soft but had a slight dip to it. The bathroom was clean and we put the dual showerheads to use. I was going to grab a drink at the bar but the $16 martini's scared us off. We were able to leave our bags after checkout and pick them up several hours later.
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 16 2009 ,This is NOT five star..............,"This is NOT a 5 star hotel. 3 at very best. Reception efficient. The hotel was very busy but this is no excuse for the room not being cleaned properly. Carpets were stained and dirty, bathroom not cleaned properly, beds not made properly, dirty towels not taken away, no robes or slippers and the whole room was dank and gloomy. Furniture was shabby and chipped, and the view terrible This was a so called 'executive' room which we paid extra for! However, the air conditioning worked well and the room was quiet given the busy location on Times Square. I would never return, one of the worst hotels I have stayed in. The streets outside are tacky and polluted to the extreme and the hotel is gloomy, dirty and dark - almost depressing. It is a real cheek to say it is 5 star. I have travelled extensively and always stay in good hotels, I can't believe how bad this was. Photos on their website are not representative.Couldn't wait to get home. Don't go there, New York is great and there must be true 5 star hotels out there!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 11 2009 ,Reasonable - few issues.,"The hotel is located in a VERY busy part of New York (close to Times Square).The staff are helpful and efficient (there were some queues to check in due to not enough staff at reception) but the hotel feels very much like a business operation. I booked a deluxe room with view (i.e. a high floor). The room we were given was a disabled access room (which was NOT what we booked despite the reception insisting we had). I had no choice but to accept the room as I was informed that all the other deluxe rooms were taken. In the end, after going back to reception again to complain, a different member of staff easily found an alternative deluxe room which was somewhat strange given the previous lack of suitable room. The room was located on the highest floor with a view of New York, though the window was very small (not ceiling to floor windows unfortunately). The room was nicely decorated and clean, though I am not a fan of the stainless steel sink in the bathroom, which feels somewhat institutional.Overall, after some initial teething problems which were quite unimpressive, we enjoyed our stay."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 10 2009 ,Better Hotel Choices in NY than the Westin,"I stay in a lot of Starwood hotels, primarily for business, and a far as I am concerned the only reason to book this one is to acquire Starwood points, or if they are running some special promotion.Here are the reasons I didn’t like this hotel:• A horrible location – all the way on the west side of Times Square which is noisy and extremely chaotic, even for New York.• This hotel will nickels and dime you to death!. No free wi-fi or free computer use in business center (I don’t understand why Starwood’s policy on this varies so much from hotel to hotel).• They charged hotel guests $10 to use their gym, which while adequate, was nothing special, and not any different from gyms in other Westins which are free to guests. When I asked them why there was a charge, they said it was run by an outside vendor. Personally I don’t care who runs it; I don’t want to have to pay for a gym in a hotel.• The bathrooms had absolutely no counter space for personal items. The stainless steel sink looked like something that could be found in a prison cell. Water pressure in the shower was not all that great.• The flat screen hotel seemed small (maybe 26 inches) for the size of the room.• Service from the staff was a mixed bag. My business colleague and I both requested a check out that was ½ hour later than the norm, and the check-in clerk was not very accommodating about this. However, I met a nice clerk the next morning who was much nicer and even gave me a free NY Times, which I had asked for.On the plus side, the rooms were nice and had very adequate desk space and a nice view.However, the bottom line, as always with a hotel, is would I stay there agai?. With thousands of other hotels in NYC, the answer would clearly be no! While I am not a huge fan of the Parker Meridian (another Starwood property), it is more than adequate, and if I was insistant on staying at a hotel to gain Starwood points, I would choose that hotel instead. But in reality, the Bryant Park and to a lesser degree, The London are my favorite hotels in NYC, and if their rates are competitive to the Starwood properties, they would be my first choice for a NYC stay."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 7 2009 ,Great Location!,The Westin Times Square was a great location to get to parts of the city. The room was large and very clean. We booked the hotel with our Starwood points so the price was perfect!
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 7 2009 ,perfect location,"Perfect location close to times square , broadway and all midtown sights.Rooms are a good size however bathroom doors don't have locks which can make toilet trips a bit more fun.Restaurant is expensive ,however the italian across the road is beautiful.Generally a good stay , I guess in new york your not in the hotel much anyway. Staff are polite and helpful."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 7 2009 ,Too many little problems to bother coming back,"Because I was attending a conference in the hotel, I wanted to push back my checkout time from noon to 2 PM. They refused and threatened to charge me $379 if I stayed past noon. So I packed and went to the front desk to check out--and complain. The desk clerk offered to let me stay till 1 PM--AFTER I had packed and left the room. At least the bellman who checked my bag for me recognized this was lousy customer service.You can't just call up and order room service--room service ordering is done through the TV, using the Menu option on the remote. That didn't work on the TV in my room. When I arrived, the room did not have a full set of towels and bath mat. The in-room internet would have cost $14.95, except that it didn't work. I was willing to pay but I could not get the system to work. At least they did not try to charge me.This is all small stuff, but it accumulated into a big pain in the neck. When there are so many other hotels in the neighborhood, why bother with the Westin?"
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 7 2009 ,So beautiful peacefulwonderful fresh air in rooms.,"This hotel has been transformed. The aesthetics,linens,layouts give a luxurious feel. We even had a view which was a first for us in NYC. Staff were helpful for sightseeing tips and directions. The location is great."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 7 2009 ,unless you want the views stay elsewhere,"An impersonnel mediocre hotel living on it's position and height in NYC. The staff are helpful enough but only if you have the patience to join the endless queues at reception. I never seen a hotel so understaffed in this respect. On the 36th floor our view was stunning but that's the only highlight. Breakfast was OK, no information in the rooms about the hotel, no room in fridge in room for personal water, no free wifi."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 6 2009 ,News Year Eve,We loved our spacious room with an amazing view to times square. I loved all that stainless steel in the bathroom. The location is perfect including an entirely indoor walk to a the theatre when travelling with teens. I stayed at a couple of other places in Manhattan and this is where I would return stay again.
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 5 2009 ,Nice hotel in great location,"Our family of 4 stayed July 31-Aug 2, 2009. The location was ideal for us- close to Subway, Times Square and Broadway. It was my third trip to NYC and this hotel was the best by far. We had ample room and a great view. The beds were super comfortable. We didn't hear or see many others on our floor yet we know it was full. We were on the 40th floor and never waited more than a minute for the elevator. It was nice to have a safe in the room to store valuables. We had a slow draining shower which was fixed on the second day without us complaining (I wanted to but didn't get around to it). The only thing I didn't like was the sliding glass door to the bathroom- frosted glass which let all of the light through-at night more of an issue- and was not soundproof. Also not much counter room in there. No pool in the hotel, but we were so busy my young teenagers didn't mind at all. The restaurant is very expensive but has great food, especially the steaks and of course New York Cheesecake. Expect to spend $50 per person if eating dinner. The Europan deli/bakery on the corner is very reasonable and has great food, fast service too."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 1 2009 ,Go Westin!!! (again) but...watch out,"Second time at the Westin in two years. Stayed for a week at the end of July. As last time couldn't fault them on service, friendliness and cleanliness. Had Kingsize room on 45th floor....great to watch the thunderstorms. However.....we had booked a club room - mainly to gain access to the club lounge inc breakfast but on check in they told us they no longer offer this service as it was not cost effective (I can understand why!). We had paid in advance due to getting a great internet rate and felt we ought to have at least had an e-mail about this. To compensate they offered us a $50 credit to our room everyday but we had to use the $50 every day and couldn't for example add up a few days for a meal at Shulas.We ate breakfast a few days in the hotel at Shulas which was lovely but would have been very expensive without the credit. We ate at Shulas one night and the food was very good but again very expensive $164 for 2 courses each 1 beer and 1 water! They were doing a 'fixed price' menu at the time for $35 per head as well.Great location and would happily recommend you to go...Enjoy!!!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 28 2009 ,Great Room and Location,"We arrived at the Westin Times Square at about 11:30am and check-in is not until 3pm but we got a room right away. The lobby was very modern, clean and attractive. The elevators are centrally located and were very fast, quiet and even had little TVs inside them. The room was very nice and clean. Also it was very spacious as far as New York City hotel rooms go. It had a flat screen LCD TV with cable and HBO. The bathroom was very nice and modern with granite tiles, and a dual shower head. The beds were very clean and extremely comfortable. The room had an iPod dock/alarm clock and complimentary Starbucks Coffee, and a complimentary paper in the morning. But possibly the greatest thing about this hotel was the location. When they say it is right in Times Square they mean it. You literally walk out of the hotel onto 42nd street and are right in heart of Times Square and midtown Manhattan. GREAT GREAT GREAT LOCATION. A subway station is also on the same block as the hotel and many others just a few blocks away so you literally dont have to walk more than a couple of blocks to go anywhere in the city."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 28 2009 ,Okay nothing special wouldn't recommend,"We arrived on Thursday night around 8. We were upgraded to a room on the 44th floor so we had a great view. As we went to our room, I noticed a room service tray on the floor a few doors down from our room. I thinking, oh, hasn't been picked up yet, no big deal. No complaints about our room and we were excited to see a small refrigerator available for our use. The bathroom was a great size. However there were no handtowels and the bathtub didn't drain well, filling up with water when we showered. Friday morning I informed the front desk of the drainage problem and it was taken care of right away. Because the bathtub problem was resolved so quicky, I was surprised that the room service tray from Thursday night was still in the hall. We left the hotel about 9, returning at 5, Friday afternoon and the tray was still there. Saturday morning around 9, I told the front desk about the tray. It is hard to believe that housekeeping hadn't picked it up yet. We stopped by the hotel about 3 and the tray was still there! At this point, I am making a mission out of getting the tray removed. Who wants to look at dirty dishes as they walk to their room? I called Service Express and told them about the tray. When we returned to our room about 7 the tray had been moved from the hall way to the table next to the elevator. I don't know if a guest moved it or if housekeeping did. At this point, I took the tray with its dirty dishes and half full pitcher of tea, down 44 floors to the front desk. I don't know what the issue is with housekeeping. There must be some kind of problem if a tray is left in a hallway from Thursday to Saturday night. Who knows how long it had been there before we checked in? If a tray can't be picked up, wonder how much cleaning really goes on in the rooms?If you want a hotel near Times Square, then this is the place for you. Personally, I would not stay in this area again. It is way too crowded."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 27 2009 ,Superb Location friendly staff,"Could not fault location we were able to walk to many attractions. Most staff are lovely. Housekeeping is a bit slow trays left in hallways for ages. Shared room with 3 women and we would have liked another mirror over the table. Overall I will book this hotel again, really clean and comfortable with helpful staff."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 26 2009 ,right on 42nd street couldn't get any more central!,This is a lovely hotel right where it needs to be. New York hotels are small (in terms of room size) but this was a decent size. the room was very modern and had everything you would expect from a hotel of this quality. The staff were great and very knowledgeable. The rooms clean and very comfortable with a few luxuries. Would recommend this again if you are staying in NYC.
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 22 2009 ,Great Stay and Fabulous Location!!,"We stayed at the Westin from Sunday to Tuesday and we had a great time. When we first checked in we didn’t have the correct voucher with us but they had no problem finding it and getting us checked in. They did it quickly and promptly without any problems. We stored our luggage in the hotel storage until the room was ready so we could explore Times Square which was a very short walk away. Solomon at the luggage storage was great! We came back to the hotel later in the day and we had a room 2508 on the 25th floor. We asked for a room on a higher floor because of what other Trip Advisor users had said and we were given one with no problems. We had a view of the Hudson River and it was beautiful! The room was a nice size for NYC and it was very modern. The room was designed nicely and very clean, but the bathroom could have had a little more counter space. The sliding door was a nice design feature in the bathroom but it didn’t lock and it didn’t help with acoustics which was a little awkward. Housekeeping did a great job with cleaning it everyday and when we would come back in the middle of the day it was always ready! The location was the best part. We were in town for a concert that was taking place in the Hard Rock Café and it was just down the street!! Super close!! It was a short walk to Times Square and the Theatre District!! We even walked to Central Park which didn’t take that long. Tons of shops, restaurants, and things to do near by!! When we checked out we stored out luggage for the afternoon while we explored the city before our flight home. They had it ready when we needed it and they even got us a taxi to JFK. Everyone was great at the Westin!!!!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 22 2009 ,Excellent hotel for families with babies; Staff is very helpful friendly!,"My wife and I decided to spend 2 nights in New York City with our 9-month old daughter. It was our first trip away from home with her, so we wanted to make sure we chose a hotel that would offer all the amenities and comforts of home. We chose The Westin New York at Times Square, and we chose right! From the moment we pulled up in front of the hotel and were greeted by Paul, the valet person, we knew this was going to be a great hotel and a great vacation. Our bags were unloaded from the car by the bell-hop immediately, and brought up to our room without a fuss. I made our reservations on-line at the hotel's own website, and there was a space to enter special requests for our room. I requested a &quot;Heavenly Crib&quot; for our baby, as well as a refrigerator and microwave to store and prepare her food. Within tens minutes of our arrival to our room, room service delivered the crib, fridge and microwave with a smile. Upon checking in at the reception area on the 2nd floor, we were told that our room had been upgraded to a Corner King room, which was the perfect size to accommodate the crib and still provide room for my wife and I to comfortably move around the room. All the Westin employees were friendly and cheerful. You'd see a bell-hop in the elevator or a maid in the hall and they'd all stop for a moment and say &quot;Hello, how are you today?&quot; The location is great--just a block west of the hustle and bustle of Times Square--and access to all the major subway lines is literally around the corner, so you can get anywhere you need to go to in a matter of minutes. We took our daughter to the free water-park/playground in Madison Square Park (23rd street and Madison Ave on the N, R, or W subway) and she loved it. We also took her to Toys R Us in Times Square and her eyes lit up the entire time. The day before we checked out, we took the subway to Union Square/14th Street and bought a bunch of fresh fruits and veggies at the Farmers Market to take home with us. We ordered in-room dining each night, and the food was excellent. The gnocchi with chicken and vegetables in vodka sauce was delicious, and even something as simple as a cheeseburger was really tasty. If you're traveling to NYC with young kids or infants, I'd definitely recommend the Westin New York at Times Square for an easy, stress-free experience."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 22 2009 ,Everything below average except vacation,"Booked a corner suite at 10am , and on arrival at the hotel at 1pm, booking was lost - I had to go to print it from Business centre. I was told it would not be available until 7pm. What kind of hotel is set up like that? Front Desk staff (Ceaser) surly and unhelpful - why would a responsible Front Office person hire someone to do this. He rebooked us into a smaller suite (yes, at a lower rate) but with no door between the master and the living room - and when the sofabed is open in the 'living room' - no room to live. Three phone calls and six hours later, the mssing room service and guest service menu appeared. Just below below average for a Westin"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 19 2009 ,Great Hotel ,"Excellent, clean, quite rooms and was 1/2 blk away from the center of Times square. About 85% of the things that we wanted to do was within walking distance of the hotel. The other places that we wanted to go was a block walk to the nearest subway station or a cab ride away. The staff were very helpful in answering any questions."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 19 2009 ,Great stay no problems,"I recently spent a week at this Westin with my daughter. I am a Starwood member and used my points for the room. We had a nice room on the 41st floor. Upon entering the hotel, we were cordially welcomed in the lobby. As we would be arriving in the city early, I had called the day prior and requested early check in. We had a short wait in the preferred check in line, but we were checking in when most were checking out. Check in was extremely quick and they had our room ready for us (11 a.m.) I also asked if they had a refrigerator available as my daughter has allergies and it is most helpful to have a refrigerator. She informed me that they would have one sent to our room. I also asked for 4:00 late check-out and this was never a problem. I found the location to be fine. We were one block from Times Square. Subway entrance was very close. As we were there for a week, this became an easy means of travel once we figured it out (cheaper than the taxis). The staff in the lobby were always very helpful answering questions and assisting us with maps. The hotel is attached to a movie theater which was great for an evening entertainment. The hotel was very clean. I seldom choose to use the additional costs of internet and phones, so the pricing did not matter. We found free access to the internet in Times Square and I believe the restaurant near the theater had free wifi, although we did not use it. I did have some problems with my cell phone signal in the hotel room.This was my second stay in New York City, previously staying at a Sheraton. I found this hotel to have a larger room size. Overall, I would recommend this hotel. No problems, no complaints. I would stay here again, especially on points."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 19 2009 ,Christmas in NYC (at the Westin Times Square),"My wife and I stayed at the Westin Times Square (&quot;WTS&quot;) between December 23, 2008 and December 27, 2008. The hotel wasn't our first choice but we were able to secure a smoking rate during the high travel season in the week before Christmas. When we arrived the evening of 12/23, I was expecting to have to wait in line for a while prior to checking in - that was not the case. There were hardly and people waiting in the check-in line. We were designated a room on a higher floor (can't remember the floor # exactly but we needed to use to second elevator bank that only served the top floors). Our luggage arrived at our room only a short time after we did, and the bellhop was extremely nice and offered many great suggestions. I was a little skeptical of what to expect of the room itself after some of the reviews I'd previously read on TripAdvisor, but upon inspection the room was very clean and surprisingly comfy given its smaller size than I was accustomed to. Our view gave to the Hudson River, and we could even see some of the lights of Times Square. My only complaint of the room would be the bathroom - it was small and lacked the countertop space for my wife and me to store our bathroom items.I know some people have written complaints of the customer service at WTS. We didn't have any bad experiences with the staff, and in fact, we actually had one of the desk clerks go out of his way for us on Christmas night. Due to the holiday, most of the good restaurants were not open for dinner. We had the option of eating at one of the chain-restaurants in Times Square but wanted something different. We settled on trying to find authentic NYC pizza and asked a gentleman at the front desk who immediately rattled off the names of his favorite places. He then picked up the phone and began dialing until he found one that was open. We grabbed a cab and dined on fabulous pizza at Joe's (as seen in the Spider Man movies). We never would have found this place (and it's entirely possible we wouldn't have gotten to eat that night) if not for the front desk agent.Overall Pros of WTS:Central locationEasy access to cabs/limosOnly a 5 minute walk to the heart of Times Square and even less to the nearest subway entrance (if I recall you can access several different lines all within a stone's throw of the hotel)Has that &quot;Westin hip&quot; feel that I've grown to expect of this brand.Overall Cons of WTS:Some of the surrounding streets are not the cleanest nor do they attract people you would want to associate with (clearly this is due to the fact that Times Square is so close, but it was definitely something worth noting).Small bathrooms.Uber-expensive cocktail lounge (hey it's NYC - everything is expensive here).Business center is not free to use a computer and I recall they charge by the minute."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 19 2009 ,Great view but at a price,"We stayed at the Westin over the 4th July weekend last year and arrived at around 7pm on Friday evening from the airport after a flight from London. The first thing we heard was the our room (Deluxe Corner King) wasn't ready as a number of house keeping staff had not showed up for work due to the 4th July celebrations. This wasn't what we wanted to hear after a long journey.We were offered a transfer to another hotel in the area, but I had specifically decided on the Westin after much research. We've already been to Manhattan 7 times so you start to get picky about where you stay. We were then given vouchers for drinks in the lobby bar and told to return in an hour. At about 9 the room was still not ready but we were told that it would be. Finally it was ready and to thank us for our patience and good humour we were rewarded with full access to the Executive Club lounge, daily breakfast in Shula's, further drinks vouchers and $150 credit. I don't think they could have done more.The room was nice, though I've been in larger and paid a lot less. We had a great view from the 36th floor towards the Hudson and north up 8th Ave towards Columbus Circle. The bathroom was spacious but rather severe with the black slate flooring which was hard on the feet after a while. The hallways on each floor were simply standard hotel fare which could easily have been in a 2* motel - nothing special.While the lobby was quite spacious and on two floors, it did feel a bit like a department store having to ride an escalator to reach reception. However, it was an oasis of calm compared to the crowds outside.The hotel was nice and I'm glad we had the chance to stay there once. However, I would not choose to stay there again, mainly because the location was far too busy and I didn't think the interior of the building was special enough to warrant the room rate. However, I suppose this is partly due to the location, right in the centre of the action."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 18 2009 ,Great Location....But,"Hotel location is great. Easy walk to everthing. Checking in was told only room available was a handicapped room. Stating I wasn't handicapped and reminding clerk I had made my reservations in March I wanted the room I had booked. Reluctantly, she gave it to me. Stated it was an upgrade. I don't think so. Room was great - very large. Housekeeping was another issue. One morning opened coffee pot to find used coffee bag still in it. Next day no coffee at all plus no cups and dirty rag left behind. Bed was not a Heavenly Bed. Hard as a rock. Staff was not friendly. Not willing to help except for nice man who helped me Fed Ex packages home. IThese are little things. If you can get past all that I would definitely give it another try."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 17 2009 ,Worst service - need to remove Westin's name from this hotel,"As a Starwood platinum member for several years, I have come to appreciate the Westin brand in many cities and vacation spots. This hotel is clean and the initial impression is comensurate with that of other Westin's. The service, however, was terrible. Prior to check in, I was assured on the phone that my room would be upgraded. After waiting in the Gold/Platinum check in line for 40 minutes, the clerk informed me that no check in was available, but they would upgrade me for the following night and move my luggage. After repacking the following morning, I came back the following night and found that the hotel failed to fulfill its promise. I went back to speak to someone. I waited again for 45 minutes in line as no one was available other than a single front desk person. Vanessa appologised for my experience and &quot;guaranteed&quot; me a move the following day. She asked me to repack my luggage the following morning for the room move. When I returned to my hotel that night, I was told they were unable to upgrade me. I asked to speak to a manager. I was told that one was not available. I left my phone number, but did not hear back. When I finally returned and found one, the manager was appologetic, but most unhelpful. I am okay with waiting in lines. I am also okay with not being upgraded. I am not okay with being lied to or messed with. It felt like the staff had no respect for my time (packing and unpacking twice), waiting in line. I have requested that this hotel be removed from my firm's preferred vendor list."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 15 2009 ,Always a great place to stay in NYC!,"I always stay here when traveling by myself to NYC. I was excited to bring my 3 young children back with me for the Macy's Parade. The general manager had promised me it would be a trip to remember, and she lived up to those expectations! We were upgraded to an AMAZING two-room suite and the girls had the best time 'living the high life' for the next 4 days. I felt no different about the hotel after coming there with my children - it was, as always, super clean, had an above-average staff ready to assist with anything, and was just an overall super comfortable place to come back to after a crazy day in the city. The only complaint I have is that, without fail, there was a discrepency in my final bill after I got home (I have never stayed where there wasn't one). It is never a simple process to dispute with their billing department (the only part of the property that lacks the same great service I come back for) and it is the one thing that will, eventually, prevent me from going back there if it happens again (I'm giving the property one last chance in September). My suggestion to anyone planning to stay there; is to keep all email confirmations and make sure everything on the bill is perfect before you leave. (I was unable to do this the last time since it took almost an hour for the front desk to get us a car to go to the airport and, by then, we needed to leave or miss our flight). I cannot say enough wonderful things about the property and the day-to-day staff and REALLY hope the Westin Times Square figures out a way to overcome this one short-fall.Other than the above, I think it is a guaranteed great stay if you're trying to find a quality place to rest your head in this wonderful-fun city!!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 14 2009 ,Helpless in the Westin,"The location of the Westin is nice... If you need to be right next to the subway! Otherwise, everything that we did was 7 blocks away on Broadway, the shows, the activities, the resturaunts. I was irritated that when we wanted to extend our stay, because I was almost a week late because I was stuck in Iraq due to sand storms, the Westin wanted to double the price of the room because they were filling up. Hooray for capatilism, but I will never stay there again. Another major complaint... across the board for the high end hotels (which this was not, but they think they are) the high prices for everything..... internet 20.00 per day (and was slow as hell), local calls 1.00 each, water 4.50 a 16 oz bottle... the list goes on and on... What a joke!We ended up finishing our trip at the Crowne Plaza on broadway.. much nicer room, close to all of the action, the shows, the park, the resturaunts ect.... My opinion, save the money and the hassle and stay at the Crowne!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 11 2009 ,awesome,"This place goes over and above to make you feel welcome. I had stayed there once before and wanted a room overlooking the Hudson. We went for our anniversary. Not only did we get a room overlooking the river, but the night we arrived there was a dessert for two and an anniversary card delivered to our room---no charge. :) Shula's Restaurant also did the same when we ate there and they asked what we came to NYC for. One night it was raining as we were headed to see a show. The security desk downstairs provided us with an umbrella. The room was spacious and clean, and the concierge, Melanie Portsche, was more than happy to answer any question. Also just off Broadway means it's quiet, but within walking distance of anything in Midtown. Thanks for a great trip, Westin Times Square :)"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 10 2009 ,BEST HOTEL EVER,i stayed at the westin hotel just over a week ago and i have to say it was the best hotel ever. the location was fantastic. we checked in with no problems and the reception staff were very polite and helpful. we was on the 34th floor and didint have a bad view. the room was massive and spacious alot bigger than i thought. the bed was so comfy and plenty of storage. the bathroom was big to with plenty of towels i loved the shower. we was given 50 dollars to spend on food in the hotel we used it on breakfast every morning we was there. the waiters were very polite. the food was amazing alot to choose from i got mega full. the people are polite friendly and very helpful. when i go to new york again i will be defiantly staying in that hotel you cant fault it. id recommend it to anyone.
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 9 2009,Great location Yet Disappointed,"We just got back from a stay here and I was disappointed. The lobby was wonderful and the service was great. The room was spacious, yet the bed was lumpy and a bit hard. The view was alright, for it overlooked a street that was pretty, but it was blocked a little by the tops of some buildings. The location was perfect. it was in walking distant of everything. It wasn't what I expected and I wouldn't stay again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 9 2009 ,Good hotel great location,"My wife and I and two grown up sons stayed at the Westin NYC @ Times Square for 4 nights over the Independence Day holiday. (Officially named “The Westin New York City at Times Square”; why on earth do they make the names so long? )The hotel is just 300 yards away from Broadway and Times Square. It is also about 1200 yards, 10-15 minutes’ walk from the Hudson River.Check in was easy peasy and our bags arrived at the room just a few minutes later after being dropped at the porter station on the ground floor. The reception staff, porters, waiters, in fact all staff were warm and friendly at all times.We had 2 adjoining rooms on the 44th floor (I requested a higher floor, a double and a twin room) The rooms were fine, clean, with comfy beds etc, plenty of towels etc, nothing that you wouldn’t expect in a busy 4 star city centre hotel. The rooms were bigger than I expected, but in saying that, with Times Square and the rest of New York outside, we didn’t spend too much time in the hotel or the room. There was a health club and spa on the 23rd floor, but no pool. But there was a pool available in a nearby sister hotelThere were a couple of very minor maintenance issues which were hardly worth mentioning during our stay. I mentioned them to reception just before we checked out and the maintenance man was up within minutes to fix them.It irritates me that in rooms costing over £170 a night, they charge for internet accessOur rooms were on the east side of the hotel and we had a great view of the Empire State Building. However, it could have been good to have a view looking towards the Hudson River for the fireworks on the 4th of July. Restaurant Row is about 10 minutes stroll away. But round the hotel are hundreds of bars, cafes, restaurants, fast food joints around the place, from $ to $$$$$ so you will never go hungry or thirsty. We ate in Shula’s restaurant in the hotel. It was very good, but not cheap"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 8 2009 ,Great location in Times Square,"I stayed at the Westin for one night while I was on a business trip in NYC. There was no line when I checked-in, so the check-in process was very quick. My room, with a King sized bed, was nice, but not overly large. There was a little room to walk around the bed, but that's about it. There was a nice work area with ample lighting and work surface. You could even rotate the TV so that you could watch TV while working. There is both wired and wireless Internet access provided, but of course, they do charge you for it. The room had a iPod clock radio, so you could dock your iPod to the system and play your music. For the life of me though, I couldn't figure out how to work the alarm portion of the device. The sheets were clean and the bed was soft, but comfy. The bathroom was actually fairly large although much of it was wasted space. It had a walk-in shower and no shower curtain. Lighting was a bit on the sparse side for my liking. The sink was small and had virtually no counter space. The whole thing was stainless steel, and gave me the impression of something you might see in a prison cell. Most importantly, it was clean! HVAC system worked well and overall noise level in the room was low. They have all sorts of movies on demand although I didn't watch any of those. The TV is high definition and they did have several HD channels. The check-out process via the TV didn't work for me, but it wasn't that big of a deal. The bill was delivered under my door during the night and I simply had to drop my key off in an express box on my way out. A USA Today paper was also delivered in the morning.The location of the hotel was great. It's in Times Square and only a block away from the heart of Times Square. I walked to the hotel from Penn Station and it was only about a 15-20 minute walk. From the bus station, it would have only been a 5-10 minute walk. Lots of restaurants nearby and of course you are very close to all sorts of theaters.Bottom line, I would stay at this hotel again the next time I find myself in NYC."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 7 2009 ,Bedbugs,"Checked out of this hotel, Room 3909, at approximately 1:15 p.m. on Monday, July 6th. While checking out, reported bed bug bites to hotel personnel named Cesar at the front desk. He took my phone number and said someone would call me to discuss. That didn't happen. I just hope the hotel has taken appropriate measures so that the next guest doesn't suffer as I am now. Having never had this problem before, I wasn't sure when we checked out if they were actually bedbug bites, but went home and looked up online. Photos and descriptions of the bites and itching match exactly what we see on our bodies. This is phenominally disgusting."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 7 2009 ,Great hotel in perfect times square location,"Just stayed here for 4 nights. Great hotel. Got an amazing rate on Priceline $145/night. Rooms were really trendy, very clean and very spacious. Concierge was great had alot of great suggestions. If you have any doubts about staying here dont the place is fantastic."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 7 2009 ,Unexplained charges,"I pre-paid for two nights back in April. When I checked in I was told that there would be a $150 security deposit....that was somewhat ok with me. It wasn't until I got home that I noticed that the hotel was holding nearly $400 on my card. When I called to complain, billing told me that it would fall off in a couple of days. When I asked why I was charged more that the $150 deposit, she could not give me an answer. After speaking to my bank, I called back to the hotel but to no avail. The billing department would not answer their phones. I was either directed to voicemail, back to the main desk or hung up on. The lady at the main desk gave me attitude for calling back when I was hung up on. When I called the 800 number to the Starwood Preffered Guest, I was told the matter would be dealt with and someone would be calling me back within a half hour. No one ever did. I'm still waiting for my funds to be released. Aside from billing, the rooms are a good size (even though I didn't get the room with city views I booked). The location is great and although the concerige and front desk agents aren't too friendly, the luggage handlers couldn't be more helpful. Be sure to print your boarding passes in the business center...it's free."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 6 2009 ,Great hotel close to everything,"We stayed 2 nights at the Westin and were very impressed with the staff (much more friendly than the staff at San Francisco Market St. location). Very helpful. Location is less than 5 min walk from Broadway, hop-on, hop-off bus tours, subway. It is a very good launching point for all sight-seeing in NYC. The room was very clean, not much of a view, but we didn't spend much time in our room. Love the heavenly bed experience."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 5 2009 ,Service Express is anything but,"I stayed at the Westin New York Times Square for a week in June 2009 with family. We reserved Club Rooms but were advised at check-in that the Club lounge would not be available and were given $25 credit per person per day, which had to be applied against food and beverage charges (ie. could not be applied against room charge or car service). The rooms are large, the beds are very comfortable, the bathroom was large as well but done in a modern decor with slate or rock type floors and stainless steel sink which seemed a bit cold. Service throughout our staff was an issue. The only button on the phone to request various services was the service express button (ie. no separate buttons for front desk, housekeeping, bell desk, etc.). However, that button was annoying to use as often it would ring 7, 8 or 9 times before it is answered by some call centre located somewhere else in the country, which then contacts the hotel department in the hotel to arrange the service. Half the day, the requested service was not fulfilled or took a long time to fulfill. One time, my brother called the service express button many times in a row and could not get through and only got a busy signal. In desperation, we simply pressed 0, hoped for the hotel operator, managed to get her and got her to connect us to housekeeping to deal with the request we had. I had trouble with my computer and the wireless system of the hotel numerous times (the cable connection in my room was not working at all). Each time I had to call service express, which then directed me to the help desk, again located in a call centre somewhere else in the country and each time I had a different tech support representative help me with no knowledge of the history of my recurring problem with my computer and the hotel wi-fi system. A couple of times, my bill also showed a charge for a toll free call for my call being redirected by the operator to the help desk. The charges were removed when I mentioned it to the front desk but that they appeared on my bill was annoying. Housekeeping was uneven. The bed was not properly made one day as the whole comforter had slipped to the end of the bed causing the occupant of the bed to feel cold, sometimes a free bottle of water was left for us and sometimes not, sometimes toiletries were replaced and sometimes not. In the end I decided to pass on my complaints, particularly with the service express concept to the night manager. She was very understanding but I am not sure there is anything she can do to change the system. As it is though, the service express system is anything but service or express, and in a Westin chain hotel charging high prices, is simply not good enough. I cannot recommend the hotel at this point. Also a word on location. While it is located almost on Times Square at Eighth and between 42nd and 43rd Street (diagonal from the Port Authority), the Eighth Avenue side is still a bit more iffy looking than the Broadway/7th Ave. sides of Times Square. Also, perhaps of the location on such a key intersection, we seemed to hear emergency vehicle sirens throughout the day and night almost every single day and night of our stay. We were located on the 10th floor but could still clearly and loudly hear the sirens from our rooms."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 3 2009 ,Stay for the location and quiet,"We're in NY for only a few days and I chose the hotel basically for the location. It ended up being the right decision. We are 2 adults and 1 teen and I was able to get into a slightly bigger room with two doubles. The room was pretty typical and wasn't tiny like some others in the city would've been. But because of the size, it wasn't up on the nice view levels but only on the 16th floor. The things we didn't like were the mildew smell which hit you when you walked into the room; a sign of humidity but I was surprised that they didn't have a way to eliminate it. The weekend maid service was below average but during the week, the service was as expected. The beds were the standard Westin beds, comfy enough for me. Probably the best part of the hotel besides location was it was quiet. We knew the other rooms were occupied around us, but never heard them. I definitely appreciated the quietness once we were back in the room and needing to relax and at bedtime.Now back to the location. We were at 42nd and 8th street which is 1 block from the port authority station and a subway station litteraly right a few doorways down from the entrance. We used the coach USA bus from EWR and that dropped us off at the port authority station to give us only a short walk with our luggage to the hotel. Daily we used the subway and had short hops on and off the 8th street stations. That was the best. Also, the hotel being at 8th street gave us 1 block over on 9th street some nice local eating places that were removed from the times square crowds.I recommend this hotel if location is a priority. If you need space for family or mini kitchen facilities, this won't work for you."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 1 2009 ,Housekeeping Service???,"I am a SPG Gold and used points for a recent free stay. Check in was smooth and we were upgraded to a club floor room for our 3 night stay. That's where the good news ends. There were no robes in the room and we called and asked for them as well as for the down comforter to be removed. Left for dinner, nothing done. Called and they showed up at half hour later at midnight. Next afternoon, asked if we could have turndown service, agreed, returned that evening, nothing done. Clincher was the final night. Got back to the room and noticed that there was very little toilet paper left on the roll. Then noticed there wasn't any additional tissue anywhere. Another phone call. Another half hour. Free room or not, this is no way to run a Westin Hotel."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 1 2009 ,nice oasis in hectic city,"We stayed here during the last weekend in june. It's like arriving in an oasis in hectic, crowded NYC. We stayed in a club level room, these are very spacious and weel equiped. sadly there not on the highest floors, so you miss a bit of views there. During our stay the club lounge was closed. But the staff gave us a 50 dollar credit for each night of our stay. The roomservice is quick, personal and very good. very nice after a long flight from Europe. Shula's restaurant offers a fantastic breakfast and a fine diner. They have some of the best steaks I have had in a long time. Bar 10 is sometimes very busy but still OK. The location at the corners of 42nd and 43rd at 8th ave. makes it a little noisy evenb at the 16th floor, but that helps you never to forget you're in NYC. The views from the window are fantastic, I could still see a little bit of the Hudson. Eassy acces to public transport, great location to get around, near the big shops and theatres. The service is friendly, helpfull and polite. All in all a place to return to."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 30 2009 ,Great Location,"I stayed there with my 11 year old son. It was our first trip to NY. Check in was fairly smooth,however they failed to have annotated my request for an upgrade,which I had noted that I was willing to pay for. However, was told they had no other rooms as it was completely booked. Our room was fairly large and comfortable. However, we were given a room on the 7th floor, with complimentary breakfast and evening hors derves . SKIP THE BREAKFAST. The hotel is in the middle of everything,theaters,restaurants, times square,subways. The Beds are AWESOME. Would definitely stay there again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 29 2009 ,Disappointed in rooms and hotel service,"My husband and I are starwoods members and love staying at a Westin Hotel. We go into NYC a few times a year and stay over and usually are unable to stay at the Westin in NYC as it is quite pricey. Well, travelzoo had a deal, so we were psyched because it was under $250 a night, which is almost half price. So we jumped at it and booked directly through the Westin's website with the travelzoo coupon code. Well we were supposed to get a deluxe city view room, with breakfast, and free access to the gym. We got there and they only had us in a standard room. The front desk person was good about it and upgraded us to a spa room b/c they had no deluxe rooms, but I did have to argue a bit to get it. So we get into our new room, and I notice a bit of water on the bathroom floor, my husband says not to worry, probably from them cleaning. Well, turns out it was a huge leak from the toilet so we had to call and complain again and a manager was supposed to contact us right away. 30 minutes later(mind you we originally checked in at 3 and it is now after 6 at this point), no call, so my husband goes down and talks to the original guy and he upgrades us to a corner deluxe room. It was annoying and we never had this kind of experience before at a Westin hotel. The beds were not as comfy as other hotels, the mattress in both rooms, sagged and the shower in the room we finally wound up in, had poor pressure. To top it off,it was our anniversary weekend and although the location was good, I would not stay at this westin again. Very disappointed."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 29 2009 ,WHAT A GREAT HOTEL,"My family and I just returned from our trip to NYC this past weekend. The Westin hotel at Times Square was topshelf with it's service and location. Right down from the Hotel GM to the service staff, our stay was outstanding. The hotel is located in the heart of the action and offers something for everyones tastes. We will be returning very soon to this hotel!Thanks Westin Times Square"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 27 2009 ,Hotel very good service needs some help.,"Stayed at the Westin for 5 days. The locations is great, the rooms are clean and well kept. The employees at the front desk are very helpful and polite.Beware of the bartenders in the Bar 10 bar. Watch your cash. We had bought some chocolate cake and gave the bartender a one hundred dollar bill to pay for the cake. We were waiting for our change and at that time they were switching shifts. When the new bartender came on he gave us a new bill for our cake we told him that we had already gave a hundred dollar bill to the previous bartender he just laughed and said sure you did. We had to have him look through all the pervious bill holders to look for our money, he then stated that it was not there. We made him look again and surprise he found our money and gave us our change. Felt like they were trying to scam us. No apology no anything we just took our change and cake and left. Also do not buy your theater tickets there they have a 100% markup and the conceigre does not even bother to tell you that. The seats were very good but could of walked across the street and got them for one hundred dollars less!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 25 2009 ,Great time in NYC,The Westin was a great hotel. It was very clean and a good location to walk everywhere.There was 6 of us 3 Moms 3 teenage girls and it worked out very well. The best night was Saturday when Steve Carell and Tina Fey were filming outside our hotel that was fun to see and the kids thought that was great!
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 20 2009 ,Perfect for me,"I should have written this ages ago and I thought I had. My first visit to NYC and I wanted the big apple experience and boy did I get it. Got a great deal on a deluxe room at Westin. Check in was a breeze, great service. They were sorry that they didn't have a corner room for me as I requested but gave me a deluxe room on the 43rd floor. The room was perfect, great view, clean and spacius and with 2 huge and perfect beds.Daily cleaning service perfect and very friendly and helpfull to any needs we might have, 2 girls with long hair we needed lots of schampoo and conditioner. Only thing with room was that the inroom safe was locked at arrival and we didn't bother getting it open.I recomend this hotel to anyone going for a sightseeing shopping trip to New York, the location can't be beaten and hotel perfect for resting and luxury. I've stayed at many 5 star hotels mostly in London and can tell you that the Westin has set the bar pretty high."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 16 2009 ,Not as good as it seems,"This is my second visit to New York in the past 8 months and have stayed in 3 hotels in total in the city (all are luxury/ 5 star hotels). Westin, though may be attractive with its new decor and up class design plus good location, the service is one of the poorest 5 stars I have ever stayed in. First it started with a poor check-in experience. I arrived with my husband and son past midnight (after our flight was delayed due to bad weather). Being very tired and all, we were being checked-in into a room which is 'not ready'. The room door was left ajar before we entered and as we pushed open the door, the room was in total darkness and has a foul smell (my husband was brave enough to walk in but cannot find the switches to light up the room immediately). We quickly ran out and asked for a change of room. We were also assured by getting the exec floor room, we will have 24 hours internet service on the club room - but when we got to the club floor lounge later to do our online flight check in, we were told by the cleaning lady that the loungehas already closed at 10pm. So, guess what?! We have to pay $14.95/day to get the internet service in our room (so much about the exec club floor benefits). Next, breakfast at the lounge has a poor spread or choice of warm food (i clicked on the website promotion link a few days prior to my arrival to upgrade to a exec floor room with its benefits for just USD40 - thinking of the good food and service which I have experienced in similar hotels). After a long dramatic night the day before, I was looking forward to good food, but once we got into a crowded room, we found the variety was limited. It followed with a series of poor service at the business center when collecting my parcel which I ordered from Amazon (the guy sitting at the center was so unhappy - like I owe him big time. Guess who is the guest there?? I really dont feel like one). Then, when we were checking out, the housekeeping came and ask what time we would be leaving the hotel! The finale, the bell-boy asked for tips for bringing our luggages down to store, saying &quot;he won't be there later when I collect our stuff&quot; (I was thinking to give the tips when I picked up our luggages later) and being made to feel guilty if I dont pay the tips now (so I did! and again later of course). What a nightmare! Did I say earlier, the room I was given facing an ugly roof top of another building?? Especially when I had to compare to the service which I was offered by New York Palace just a few days before my stay with Westin. Heaven and Hell experience."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 15 2009 ,Lousy Service,"I stayed with 6 other family members for 2 days at The Westin, Times Square, New York in May 2009. The rooms were comfortable but below par if you consider the 'special privileges' supposedly given to a Gold Preferred Guest. One of the rooms had a bathroom door that just refused to lock itself ! And this is a major problem if you have other family members roaming around - so much for privacy ! Moreover, the other room seemed to have been in use previously on the same day and wasnt ready when we arrived. The bed wasnt made up, there was trash around and the toilet was a mess. Probably the turnover time may have been minimal, so if it is rectified, it shouldnt be a problem, right ? But after bringing it to the notice of the staff, we waited for 2 hours huddled up in the other room but no one turned up. On repeated calls, we were told the room is ready and has been serviced but when I went to check, I found out that it was still a mess - no one had come to the room ! After 3 calls and a wait of 2 hours, we left for sightseeing. Upon our return, 4 hours later, thankfully the room was as good as new and the bathroom door was fine too (thank god !). Another problem was that the complimentary coffee, sugar etc in the rooms were not replenished the next day. But by that time, we had pretty low expectations and didn't bring it to the notice of the staff.I am not very fussy generally but when your family is using a large chunk of their Preferred Guest points to book a hotel on a prime location, you expect much better. The room had all the basic comforts but the service was truly lousy ! The location is obviously a big advantage - and gives you a high to look down upon Times Square. If you want to experience this feeling, go and give the Westin a try. But if you are looking for Value for Money, you could probably give it a miss !"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 15 2009 ,Excellent Hotel,"This was our first trip to NYC and the Westin made our stay outstanding. The hotel itself is one block away from Times Square The front of the hotel sits on 8th Ave. which is home to a plethora of restuarants and activity. As for the room, it was outstanding. Like mentioned before, this was our first trip to NYC so I cannot attest the room size in comparison to other Manhattan hotels. To us, the room was a comfortable size. I feel the need to mentioned that we had a Westin Executive Club level room, so the room may be larger because of that level. The bed was comfortable and the television was large. The iMac that was in the room was essentially pointless. You have to pay for internet connectivity and we never even moved the mouse. The bathroom was....different. My wife thought it was great. It was large in size. However, to me at least, there was very little counter space and the shower was poorly designed. At 6'3&quot;, I did not have enough room to extend my elbows without hitting the double shower head or towel rake. Again though, for my wife, it was the perfect size and she loved the double shower.The only negative comment I can say about the hotel is in regards to some of the staff. With the Executive Club level room, we enjoyed the complimentary breakfast in the Executive Lounge and access to the fitness center. However, the staff in the Executive Lounge were not pleasant and seemed quite mad at the world. This statement is not to include all staff though. Several times we asked for directions or restuarant recommendation and the front desk and bellhop staff provided excellent information. Overall, this was quite an enjoyable experience. The hotel excelled in several areas and we will look into returning on our next trip."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 11 2009 ,Great Location smaller rooms,"This hotel is right in the center of the time square. It is a great location. The rooms are however a bit smaller for the price, but then this is the average size for most hotels in Manhattan area.The bed was one of the most comfortable ones I have used before.The onsite bar is a bit small and gets crowded at times, but it is very convenient if you are looking to get a quick drink.The decor and ambience is very contemporary and eye-pleasing."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 11 2009 ,Clean friendly but times square noise,"Stayed here for a second time this year and was pleasantly surprised both times. This hotel has everything you would expect from a new and well maintained Westin. Except for the St.Regis, the rooms in the Westin are far superior to the other starwood properties in the NYC area (W Hotels, Sheraton, etc). The hotel gets a more mature crowd so it is not abuse by party goers like the W. If you are a starwood Gold member or higher ask for a corner room, its a great upgrade and an even greater view. Please keep in mind that this is times square aka the &quot;tourist trap&quot; so be prepared to deal with lots of noise, the higher the floor the less noise you will have to deal with. Great access to subway - NQRW123ACES trains all within 1 block!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 8 2009 ,Just okay - a little disappointing,"After reading many positive reviews, we decided to book a room for one night. Considering the location, proximity to the Port Authority and being a Westin hotel, we really thought the hotel was going to be great. Deluxe city view was just okay. Bathroom was the best part because of the awesome double shower. Room service was fine. No complaints there. Front desk staff didn't seem to be very familiar with the area as to give suggestions of places to eat. We found that very annoying considering they are right in Times Square. Will not be coming back to this hotel. I guess we had high expectations because the Boston Westin is beautiful and it is in a very nice part of the city. Hotel location is great if you are going to a show, other than that, book somewhere else away from stinky hot dogs stands."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 5 2009 ,Great location,"Just returned from an anniversary stay at the Westin and have to say that this is a great hotel perfectly located for the tourist that wants to see the sites. Fifth Avenue, central park and Grand central station (to name just a few sites and streets) are all within walking distance. Used the subway and walked around at all times of the day and night and felt really safe.The staff where always happy to help with any questions we had. The one thing I would recommend you do though is not use the mini bar as the prices are something else! you can always get ''stuff'' in from the numerous stalls in Times square and yes as my wife say's this is me being tight with my monies but do me a favour and just take a look at the prices first before you judge me. Overall this is a hotel I would go back to and I would recommend to my best friend."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 27 2009 ,What a great place to stay while in New York,"We stayed at the Westin over Memorial Day weekend. We had such a wonderful trip. The hotel rooms were larger than most of the hotels we have stayed at while visting NYC. The staff were wonderful, very helpful with any needs, extremely accomodating. The location was perfect for going to the theatre, grabbing wondeful breakfasts in the morning at the local shops, and any sightseeing you want to do. I can't wait to go back!!!"
Westin New York at Times Square,May 26 2009,Best Hotel In Times Square,"I was in NY for a quick weekend get-a-way, checking in 5/16 and departing on 5/17. Although check-in time is not till 3pm, I was able to check in as soon as I arrived at 1pm. The staff was friendly and gave great suggestions for entertainment since our show didn't start till that evening. Most hotel rooms in NY are very small but this queen size bedroom was very comfortable and had all the amenities that I love, including the Apple iHome clock radio unit so that I can listing to my iPod. Although I was only there for a short time, I would definitely stay here at the Westin during my next visit."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 25 2009 ,All I can say is Wow,"Okay truth is i could never afford a room here but we won a 1day stay in a charity raffle for $250 the room was listed as $1500/night. We were set up in a Executive suite with all the amenities. Our room had 2 queen beds each with $2500 bedding ( the bed is really firm though), a apple computer ,a large flat screen TV, a slate stone bathroom with 2 shower heads, and a view of Time Square. The downsides are parking is 1block down the street and is only up to 24hr parking, it was cold outside we could feel the wind break thru the windows and here all noise of Timesquare, they charge you to use the excercise room and extra for internet access incl WIFI."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 25 2009,Memorable memorial weekend with kids Westin Times Square,"The hotel is located in one of the busiest sections of the city on the corner of 43rd and 8th Avenue. The check-in was easy (up the escalator) and it took about 5 minutes. We got an upgrade to 45th floor with a view of the Hudson &amp; NJ. We reserved a double since we had 2 kids with us. The room was clean and comfortable. It had a flat screen TV, but since we weren't there for business we didn't look for an internet connection. The room was a good size for NYC and was big enough for the 4 of us. It had the heavenly beds indicative of a Westin. The bathroom was larger than I expected for NYC. It was modernly decorated with a large bathtub, pocket door and double shower heads. The water pressure was a bit weak, but the bathroom was CLEAN, no mold on the shower curtain, bathtub, tiles or sink and no stray hair. My only complaint is that the toilet flushes really, really loud. We didn't use the room service or the restaurants in the hotel. There is a Starbucks (on 44th) and cafe Europa next door for coffee in the morning. No need to pay $8 for a cup of coffee or $4 for bagel.There's some construction nearby but since we were on the 45th floor we weren't bothered by the noise. I was awakened by some drunk men getting off the elevator the first night but we got them back since our kids wake up at 6am and watch cartoons. When we checked out we were charged for 6 cans of beer. I had moved them around since I wanted the room for milk in the fridge for the kids. They removed the charges and told me that the hotel offers complementary fridges and that the minibar has sensors. When the drinks are moved it's automatically charged. They were pleasant and without attitude.The hotel is in a good location. There are lots of restaurants and grocery stores one block away on 9th ave. and is in walking distance to central park (about a mile, 15 blocks). The area has changed alot since I lived there 13 years ago and Times square is alot safer and gentrified. No more hookers or x-rated shops. We felt very safe walking around even with small kids. One note skip the Waybest Diner on 9th avenue its the way worst diner we've been to but try Nick's between 50th &amp; 51st on 9th Ave. its the best Greek restaurant."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 24 2009 ,Fabulous Place to Stay in New York City!,"My friend and I needed a girls get-away weekend and always love going to New York City. The Westin, located at the corner of 43rd and 8th is a super great location. It's close to Times Square, the subway, Grey Line Tours, and of course the most important thing, SHOPPING!!!!! The view on the 20th floor was awesome - the Hudson River, 8th avenue, and lots more. The room was beautiful as was the entire hotel, a very comfortable setting, and we heard absolutely no noise in the hall or from rooms beside us. The staff couldn't have been more gracious and always helpful with information. The hotel recently added boarding pass printing for free near the business center which was appreciated. Although we didn't have time to use any of the amenities, I'm sure they are excellent as well. We would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to anyone."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 23 2009 ,Construction Everywhere - Oh the Noise noise noise,"Booked the Westin Times Square on the strength of the Westin name. The hotel was nice , but impersonal. We had a double club room on the 14th floor. The room was smaller than I expected and the charge for internet was a bit much. These rooms are not exactly budget priced . We paid extra for the club room and we got the I-Mac computer - but had to pay to get online. Our biggest issue however was that our room door faced on to an inner courtyard of the hotel - which seemed to be used as a meeting place for business. So every morning of our stay at 7:00 am it was very noisy in our room -as there were at least 150 people milling about below our rooms clanging plates, cups etc... and chatting. That was annoying to say the least. We had asked for a quiet room and we dismayed to hear this chaos first thing in the morning. Also, throughout the night there was a lot of noise from nearby construction going on - New York is truly the city that never sleeps - at least it's construction crews! Again, the hotel was nice - but not really worth the price we paid. I have stayed in many hotels far superior at a much better price - Next time, we'll be at the Affinia Shelburne or Dumont, the Lucerne or the Blakely - they have the personal touches that make you feel special.On the upside the door men and gentlemen at the courtesy/ security desk were quite personable and helpful."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 22 2009 ,Great hotel ,"The Westin Times Square was a great place to stay for a fun weekend in NYC. It was an easy walk to the Broadway show we saw and since the weather was beautiful, a nice walk to the south end of Central Park. Thankfully its a couple blocks from Times Square so not quite as crowded. The room was spacious, trendy &amp; had a pretty good view. The hotel bar was chill and the service was excellent. Highly recommended (and a great value if you can catch it on Priceline)."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 20 2009 ,Really enjoyed the Westin,"My husband and I stayed at the Westin for 1 night while my parents were in town visiting. We booked a high floor room with a view and that is exactly what we got. We had a great view where we could see 42nd street and some of Times Square. The room was very clean. The TV was a little bit small, but the furnishings were nice. As others have noted, the sliding bathroom door is a bit weird. Check-in was smooth and the staff was very friendly. I thought the lobby was really nice. They have a Shula's there. Have not eaten at that location, but have in other cities and we really enjoy the food there. Wanted to check out the bar but it was closed when we got back to the hotel after gallivanting around town. We would definitely stay here again. The location is great!"
Westin New York at Times Square,May 19 2009 ,never disappointed !,Just back from our second stay there. Incredible location. Nice view on the Hudson River ( high floor ). Room big enough by NewYork standards. Staff very welcoming. Only complaints = a little hot in the room / internet should be free considering price of rooms . Plan to visit again !
Westin New York at Times Square,May 19 2009 ,Room smelled.,"We only stayed one night, but we found the staff to be unattentive, carpet in room very dirty and the toilet made a harsh sound when flushed. The Good Stuff - we got a discount on Parking, the shower and bed were amazing. Location was good.."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 17 2009 ,Like staying in a college dorm,"With big hotels like this you'll get lots of mixed reviews. If you're used to staying in a LaQuinta - this place is fine. If you're used to staying in something better, you'll wish you'd gone somewhere else.My normal standby hotel in mid-town was sold out and the Westin was only two blocks from where I was supposed to go to a meeting. As such, I thought I would try it out - that turned out to be a bad idea. Like most large hotels in mid-town the Westin is more like a college dorm. The rooms are tiny, the ceilings are low, and everything just seems worn and cheap. The hotel had a &quot;modern&quot; look to it that showed signs of wear given the huge numbers of guest who churn through the revolving doors each day.When I checked in the didn't have the type of room I'd reserved, so they downgraded me without downgrading the price. When I asked if they'd lower the rate, they did. However, when I got the final bill they'd only made the change for one night. I called and they were happy to change it for both nights. It wasn't hard to get done, it was just a pain.The Westin beds were quite comfortable and the floor we were on was very quiet. Our maid was nice and thorough. However, she could only work with what she had. The bathroom was very small and had a polished aluminum or stainless steel sink that looked like it was straight out of a prison. The shower was small with terribly weak water pressure.There were plenty of clean towels but the toilet paper seemed cheap.The closet had full length mirrored doors that looked straight out of the 1980s. There was over-priced wifi internet with slow connection speeds.The worst part about the hotel was the premium price for the sub-par hotel.If you're going to mid-town, you can do better than the Westin."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 15 2009 ,never fails to meet my expectations.,"This is my third trip to NY and having tried other hotels for a couple of nights I have always returned to this one. From the moment you walk in the door - one block away from Times Square and Broadway - the staff make you feel very welcome and you get the impression that nothing would be too much trouble for them.The hotel is well maintained and very clean if a little impersonal in it's decor. Elevators are always available to take guests to the higher floors. The cocktail bar is decent and Shula's restaurant does great steak!All the rooms I have been in have been well presented, large by NY standards and well equipped, with all electrical goods operational and easy to find. The coffee machine in each room is a nice touch with STarbucks coffee available as complimentary.Hotel is in ideal location to Times Square and Broadway and the hotel staff are always on hand to help out with any queries you may have about the local area, showtimes, tours etc.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in NY."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 12 2009 ,Not horrible but I wouldn't stay here again,"My husband and I live in NYC, but stayed at the Westin Times Square last Thursday night for a &quot;night out.&quot; The room was so-so. The outlet in the bathroom is over the toilet, so you literally have to blow your hair dry over the toilet. Another problem - you get no cell phone reception in the hotel, so you have to use the hotel phone to make all of your calls and they charge several dollars for each call (I think about $5 per call with taxes, but can't recall for sure), so it adds up quickly. Also, no cell phone service means no blackberry service, so I had to log on to my computer (pay $15 for internet service) just to see if I had received e-mails. The bed was comfortable and we got a good night sleep even though you can hear noises from other rooms (people sneezing, flushing the toilet, etc., but no street noise). We went to the hotel's bar for a drink and got great service and good drinks. However, the hotel service is not so great - we called the front desk three times and asked for laundry bags, but they were never delivered."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 4 2009 ,Great View Clean Comfortable Rooms Heavenly Shower Comfortable Bed Perfect Location... Horrible Internet!!!!!,"My husband and I stayed at the Westin for 3 nights in NYC April 2009. The location was great for seeing shows. The hotel can be accessed from either 42nd or 43rd and it's right in the middle of all the action. If you want to stay in the heart of Times Square - this hotel is definitely a great option!We encountered one &quot;not so friendly&quot; host at the front desk and she told us our room was not ready to try back in an hour. This was at 3:00 pm and she wasn't at all apologetic. They could have put us in another room immediately but since we had reserved a &quot;view&quot; room that wasn't ready yet - we decided to wait. The wait paid off and we got a beautiful view from the 41st floor!!! We could see the Empire State building and even a little bit of the water on the other side.The $15/day internet access was horrible!!! The wireless connection was so low I could barely use it, and the wired connection was slow and unreliable. I tried to download a couple of large files I really needed and wasn't able to get them downloaded. I feel like if they are going to ask guests to pay $15/day they should at least offer reliable high speed service.Overall I had a great time though! The rooms were clean. The dual head shower and bed were both heavenly! The street noise was never a problem and we never heard noise from other guests. It was close to all the wonderful Broadway shows NYC has to offer!!!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 28 2009 ,Had a great time,"Stayed at the Westin Times Square the first weekend in April. In town to see the Cubs vs Yankee and see a play. Arrived for our shortened weekend , due to weather (both coming and going) after midnight. Received an upper floor corner room with club floor access. Room was decent size ( for New York), clean and had windows on two walls ( great view). Bathroom good size, but not enough counter space. Location ideal just steps from Times Square and subways. There is a diner ( WestWay ?) 2 blocks away, good for a quick late night bite. Also had breakfast ( about $7 ). Had a lovely dinner at Trattoria Trecolori??. Food was very good and best of all not very expensive. Westin Club access came in handy. All day refreshments available, plus continental breakfast and evening drinks and appetizers. All staff we came in contact with were very friendly and courteous. There is a movie theater and additional restaurants located in the same building. Even though our 3 day weekend became one, we had a great time. Will definitely choose the Westin NY Times Square again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 27 2009 ,Top Class Hotel in a Top Class Location,"My stay at the Westin was my first in New York City.Me and My girlfriend were staying for 11 nights, we booked a deluxe room through our local travel agent, costing around £1200 each including our flight from London Heathrow.Before we flew I contacted the hotel and mentioned that we were flying on valentines and because of the time difference and long flight we weren't going to celebrate it till the 17th of February.When we arrived they upgraded us to a Deluxe Corner Room which offered great views of Times Square and The Hudson river.The room was huge and so was the TV and Bathroom.The hotel staff were really friendly and the cleaning staff were very good.The Heavenly bed lived up to its name.One of the most random things the hotel offer was the view from...yes it's loo, from...let's say the thrown, (see pictures)We ordered room service on our first day as we were shattered from the flight, Shula's steak house offered a great selection in-room service and actually in the restaurant itself. The prices are reasonable.During out visit we felt right at home and welcome on our first visit to NYC.There was no draw backs to the hotel only that we had to eventually leave.NYC to me is the best place to visit i would return but only after sampling a few other New York hotels.Overall this is up there with most 5 star hotels in New York City.Thank you from a happy satisfied customer."
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 27 2009 ,Not great not like a Westin should be,"You can tell a lot about a hotel from the moment you arrive.Well, I pulled up outside the Westin only to be ignored by the numerous bell-men down stairs. They looked more like night club bouncers or heavies and not at all welcoming.The reception is huge, cold, impersonal and quite ugly.As for the rooms, well, again nothing special. Small &amp; compact but bland and boring come to mind. Looks like the hotels were furnished about 10yrs ago and haven't been touched since and everything looks a little worn around the edges.This hotel seriously needs a make-over and is trading on its brand name &amp; location.This hotel seriously dilutes the image of the Westin brand and was a real disappointment."
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 24 2009 ,Westin can do better than this...,The first impression is that the hotel is dark. Very poorly lit. It was darker indoors than outdoors in the middle of the afternoon. I requested a king bed but the room had two double beds. The room was quite small. I travel alot and this is one of the smallest rooms I have ever stayed in. The bathroom was not clean when I checked in. The service was rather good. I requested a small refrigerator so I could store breastmilk that I pumped while I was on a business trip. It was delivered right away and he noticed that there was a tear in the desk chair that I didn't even see. He took the chair away and replaced it immediately. The food could be better. They charge $15 for internet. This was disappointing for a Westin.
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 22 2009 ,Westin-swish but could do better,"Good stuff:The position of the hotel is very good, just a short walk to Times Square. Views from higher floors are excellent. Clean and tidy in foyer. Modern look. Bell-boys very efficient. Heavenly beds very comfy. Quiet rooms. Junior suites are very good size, with 2 flat screen TV's, and lots of space. Nicely decorated.Bad stuff: Reception can get very busy. Pull out double bed in Junior suites are ridiculously uncomfortable, virtually unusable. Bar drinks, and mini bar drinks very expensive. Slapdash room maid-didn't replenish hot drinks sachets properly, or glasses and cups.Main issue with our stay, which overall was great, was check-in and room readiness. We arrived at 2.30pm to check into our Deluxe room with 2 doubles. Check in time is 3pm, and our room was not ready. I've never been to a hotel, that didn't have a room ready 1/2 hour before guests are likely to arrive. Not a great problem, we did full check-in and were told to return in at 3.30pm. We did so, only to find the world and his wife were either checking or checking out. Likely to have to queue for an hour just to get our key. Spoke to the concierge who was doing nothing, and rather than moving she said I should go see the manager. Found the manager, asked if he could issue my key. He went away for over 5 minutes, and came back to tell me my room was still not ready. I explained very politely that we'd been travelling for over 12 hours, and I expect my room to be available. To give him his due, he went away ( for another 5 minutes) came back very apologetic, and had found an available room. We shot up to the 38th floor, opened our room door to find it already occupied. Not best pleased with the hotels performance so far (as well as their security) I found the manager again, suggested an upgrade might be appropriate, and he apologetically again, found a Junior suite. We were all very pleased with this room, particularly the gigantic bed. Our enthusiasm was diminished, when we found the pull out bed had got used sheets on it (yuk). Got these changed pretty quickly. My teenagers delight at their own TV and their own area of the suite, was quelled when it came to sleeping on the pull out bed, which was too uncomfortable for words. In fact one of them slept on the floor!!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 17 2009 ,Great location for Shows and Tours,I was very satisfied with the hotel. We stayed in a deluxe room with two beds. If you have a refrigerator get your own water and knick-knacks. Loved the green tea soap. When we closed the blinds it was truly dark. Watch out for the toilet if you are not used to a forcefull flush. It was a great location for tourist. Just a short walk into the middle of Times Square. If you want to see a show it's just a few blocks away. We went to see The Lion King (awesome!). If you want to go on a tour of the city the Grey Line Tour Center it's just a few blocks away. Ask the concierge for restaurant suggestions don't get trapped in Times Square or stuck eating the expensive (but tasty) Shula's/room service. I enjoyed Juniors for a few breakfasts and lunch.
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 17 2009 ,Amazing location,"Was very happy when we got to the Westin and discovered just how close we were to Times Square and the subway. The subway was literally 30 seconds out the hotel (or another entrance 2 minutes down the road for another line) and Times Sq was a 2 minute walk round the block. Check in was swift, rooms were ready straight away. Room was nice - small - but what we expected from a New York hotel to be honest. Yes its true to say there are no locks on the bathroom door (it's a sliding door and although isn't see through, you can see shadows through it). But if the door's closed you know someone is in there, so wasn't a problem at all. We had a twin room with 2 double beds and it's true what they say about the Heavenly Beds and Heavenly Showers - they really were! The bed has to be the most comfortable I have ever slept in. More comfortable than my bed at home - wish I could afford to buy everything (you can buy it all but it's a lot of $$!). The shower has the option to have on 2 shower heads (or just one if you want to save energy but what the hell) which made for a lovely hot power shower. Maids were in everyday making the beds and changing towels but never early enough that we saw them or they got in our way which was great. Had a paper delivered every morning and coffee facilities were topped up every day. One thing I did miss was tea facilities. Us English do like a cup of tea, but all they had was coffee (my friend was pleased as they provide Starbucks coffee which he loves but not good for me as I hate coffee). Just a few tea bags and a kettle would have been sufficient - all they had was a caffetier and coffee granules.We had a view over the Hudson River which was lovely. We were 45 floors up with a fantastic view and didn't hear any noise at all from the streets below. One down side to the hotel is how much it costs to make a phone call from the room. We are from England and made calls back home and even calling a landline in London, where someone didn't pick up and it just went to answerphone where we immediately hung up cost $18. A 20 minute call to London cost $150! And I am not joking. We were shocked when we got the final bill. Lots of £18 for when people hadn't been home and a couple of $150's! I assume all these hotels would be the same but please don't use the phone - it's cheaper to use a mobile! When you check in you have to leave a credit card and they automatically 'hold' £150 per night you are staying there for 'incidentals' then at the end of your trip they obviously decuct phone calls, mini bar, internet etc from it and put the rest back on your card. We weren't prepared for this as it's not on their website, and a 6 night stay meant we needed $900 or about £600GBP free on a card for them to 'hold'. We ended up going to the business centre and transferring money about so we could do it. I knew they'd want a credit card but had no idea about the £150 a night rule. So be prepared for this.The business centre wasn't really much of a business centre - 2 computers and one printer. But didn't seem to be busy so was adequate enough. You can call up and get a code to use with your laptop for wireless internet in your room which was fairly OK with rates - think it worked out as $60 for a week which wasn't too bad for the type of hotel it was I didn't think. It's what you'd expect to pay anyway. Bar was nice, bit overpriced but so are all hotel bars. Somewhere to have one drink and then move on elsewhere I think. Was fairly busy early evening with business types. There is also a gym but we didn't use it. After a certain time in the evening you have to show your keycards as you come in the door (the reception is after this, up some escalators) so felt this hotel had very good security and felt safe in the complex. The doormen are friendly and will get you a taxi at the drop of a hat. Overall I loved the Westin, have booked to stay in their Vegas hotel and hope it is just as good, and when I return to New York in October 09 I will be staying at the Westin again. It's in such a great location, right next to the subway, supermarket and chemist over the road, there's even a Starbucks and cinema attached to the hotel if you dont want to go out as well as Shulas Steakhouse which is their own restaurant. Didn't use it but menu looked good! There is another Starbucks over the road though, and a McDonalds. It's quite expensive (a 6 night stay cost us £1100 which was about $2000 at the time would be more in £'s now with the rubbish exchange rate) but well worth the price I think."
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 15 2009 ,Not impressed,"Reception staff and concierge services were highly inattentive to our needs, we booked a deluxe room and found nothing to be deluxe about it. There were no bathroom door locks, stainless steel wash basin and wc reminded me of a cheap motel, no shower gel provided so bring your own. &quot;Express&quot; room service was the slowest and most surly I have found in any country. Upon complaining, the hotel management tried their best to make things right for us and sadly failed on every occasion to make our stay bearable, even when they supplied cookies and milk for our daughters they accidently included a peanut cookie among the choc chip cookies that left our 8 year old daughter with blistering of the lips and hives until the early hours of the morning. This was supposed to have been a once in a lifetime treat for my wife and family and sadly our stay in Manhattan was marred by employees who just didn't seem to understand that they are in the hospitality business."
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 15 2009 ,Grumpy Staff,"This hotel has a great location, but the front desk is busy and understaffed and grumpy, no smile, no welcome greeting from them at all, seemed like it was an inconvinience to have me staying there. The rooms were good, bed was nice, bathroom was clean.The interenet should be free considering the amount you pay for the room, and since this is suppose to be a business hotel. Pity about the grumpy staff."
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 14 2009 ,Quite nice,Stayed at the Westin Times Squre for 3 nights. Very nice room and clean upon arrival. Check in was a bit of a mess as the person at the desk did not speak perfect english and misunderstood some things we said. Everything got cleared up though. Concierge service was very good and the hotel gave us umbrellas to borrow on a rainy day. Only hitch was coming back one evening to find the room had not been touched by housecleaning service. We had to call a few times and wait but eventually they sent someone. It was not cleaned as thoroughly as during the day but at least we got fresh towels and some tidying up. We got a great deal for hotel and air on travelocity so it was worth the money.
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 14 2009 ,Expected much more!,"Westin is located right in the heart of Times Square, a good spot, but maybe too busy (even for NY standards) if you're staying several days.Bought a standard room, no cancellation possible, for 6 nights; at 250usd per night. I was expecting a nicer hotel and room (even it's just ok in all points). All the 'heavenly' features are just marketing.Disliked the lobby, with loud chill-out music, very unfriendly. Also the noisy toilette flush.Liked the comfortable bed. (specially after walking all the city!)"
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 13 2009 ,Perfect Location,"Stayed for four nights in early April. This is a perfect location for travelers looking to see the sights of NYC. Right in the heart of Broadway -- all theaters are within a 5-10 minute walk. Times Square is one block up, and virtually everything was within walking distance. Nicely decorated, fabulous bed &amp; bath. Rooms were a little small, but that's to be expected in New York. Cab rides are about $45 from JFK. Internet was about $15 a day -- should be free. Hotel bar is VERY expensive."
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 13 2009 ,Although good location and rooms poor maintenance and service,"I travel to NY frequently and have spent a lot of time at this hotel. However, this will not continue in the future. If you are traveling for leisure, this hotel is probably fine. It is well located and the rooms are relatively nice. However, if you are traveling for business, I would stay away from this hotel. The issue is with the room maintenance and the service. I have the following things not work in the past 3 months in different rooms: iron, light switch, bathroom light switch, TV controller, electronic door and phone. In each case, it takes forever to get them fixed and the staff response is horrible. Going to management of the property is no more helpful. I would advise that for business travelers this is a poor choice versus some other options. Things tend not to work well throughout the hotel and getting them fixed in a timely manner is impossible. It may have a WESTIN name on the door, but you get the service of a Four Points by Sheraton. I have more stories than I care to list, unfortunately, to substantiate this."
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 12 2009 ,Westin Times Square -- Great Location without the hustle ,"We spent the long weekend in NYC and really enjoyed our stay at the Westin. This hotel is one block from Times Square on 43rd St &amp; 8th Ave, so you don't get the same amount of foot traffic as to when you stay on Broadway or 7th Ave. This hotel is within walking distance of Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Theaters, and subway stations. Location is great if staying in the City and value being in the hub. As for the hotel stay, we were taken care of from the minute we dropped our car at valet parking. This was really convenient unlike other Starwood properties near Times Square where you have to park yourself. Convenience is the key when traveling with family. The room was clean and the bed heavenly as promised. The hotel had a decent size room for NYC (Executive Club Floor) , plus it was recently renovated by an artist. We had one special request issue, but was taken care of and followed up by management. Not an issue, but thought I would mention that the hotel isn't perfect, but close to it. We are big fans and would stay there again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 8 2009 ,Great location and executive level room size is nice and roomy,"Our family stayed for 7 nights over Spring Break this year. First time in N.Y. and we were totally clueless about where to stay. Felt a sense of comfort knowing this was the Westin. We are SPG members and used points for 2 of our nights. Great choice. Pros~ We were given the opportunity to remain in the same room even though we had multiple reservations. Beds were extremely comfortable and rooms were quiet and recently updated. Temperature in rooms was excellent. WIndows opened slightly for us to feel the snow falling one morning. Executive level staff was very attentitive to our needs at all open hours. Willing to go into the back for soft drinks upon request as children are not juice or coffee lovers in the am. Elevators worked like a charm-nice and speedy-never a long wait. Connected to a movie theater and a starbucks on side wing. A great tex-mex restaurant also connected. Check in was speedy and courteous. We were put in a room that was larger than nearby rooms. Plenty of shampoo and lotions each day. Bathroom was clean and tidy. Shower head was double and water was always nice and hot. Towels were soft and clean. Breakfast was always hot and fresh each morning. I loved the hot oatmeal. Some mornings, it seemed watery but mostly it was thick and creamy. Having the Port Authority just a hop,skip and a jump really aided us well as we always felt like we had nearby subway stop or bus ride. We used the taxi to get from Newark upon arrival (DO NOT DO THIS) Take the bus from Newark if you are staying at this hotel as the ride was very pleasant and comfortable and a little cheaper.Cons~Having a computer in our room but internet access was an additional charge. This was very misleading as we asked our reservationist and was told internet access was free. Upon checking with front desk, we were told we had to go to executive lobby for it to be free. :( No use having a computer in our room. Our room had a view of the tops of buildings nearby and of Madame Tousseau's sign. Was hoping for a partial times square view but understandably at this level that was near impossible. The neighborhood immediately surrounding was not the best but we were always alert and traveled in group. Lobby was a little too plain and drab. Staff was not overly friendly~courteous, but not overly friendly. We were not given Metro cards per our reservation details (some sort of sports pkg.). We realized this after and we didn't need it anymore. Bell men never greated us each time we walked in the door throughout our stay. A simple hello would have gone a long way. One day our maid skipped our room but we made a call and service was prompt. Bathroom shelf was small and placed poorly in the bathroom. (above the toilet and sink) We had a disaster with make up bag falling into the toilet. I had remembered reading about this after it happed to us. :( Overall we loved this hotel and there were no hidden surprises except for the internet access charge. I would recommend this hotel."
Westin New York at Times Square,Apr 5 2009 ,Great Hotel. Sets an example for the Starwood brand.,"Just spent one night at this Westin. As a platinum member I was given a small pamphlet summarizing the amenities being offered. I was only on the 28th floor but the view was breathtaking. A corner room is definitely a plus! This property is well decorated, the rooms comfortable and the staff very professional. The location is perfect for a quick business stay or an extended leisure stay. 42nd street itself offers great cinemas and theaters and also provides convenient access to the subway system. Times Square is only one block away, as well. Even Central Park is a pleasant walk when the weather is nice. I especially liked the fact that some of the windows can be opened a few inches for fresh air. The only change that I would hope to see is the switch to fitted sheets on the matress."
Westin New York at Times Square,Mar 28 2009 ,best bed,westin always been known for their best bed. compare to hilton westin bed is always the best. location cleanliness etc etc is always perfect
Westin New York at Times Square,Mar 24 2009 ,Excellent Stay at the Westin Times Square,"I just enjoyed a very nice long weekend in late March at the Westin. The location is outstanding, one block from Times Square but somewhat sheltered from the sensory barrage that makes Times Square so fun. We reserved a junior suite since I was traveling with kids. The room was immaculate, appeared to be newly renovated, spacious and was very comfortable in every way. We were on an upper floor but the view was nothing special, didn't pay for the premium views. Room service was very good, in the fashion of a fine hotel. The bed and linens are truly heavenly, and the bathroom was huge. Definitely one of the better big-city Westins out there. The rates for the weekend were amazingly good, a total steal in my opinion for this hotel in this location (internet fee notwithstanding). We found the staff to be friendly and helpful. One of our special requests did not arrive in a timely fashion, and when I called again, they were so apologetic and went overboard to be nice. I had several calls from management afterwards to make sure things were fine, which was a very professional touch. It is a big hotel, and I am sure they get overwhelmed at times, but I was perfectly happy with the level of service.If traveling with kids, don't miss the Toys R Us megastore in Times Square and do buy a $4 per person ticket to ride the ferris wheel inside. Mars 2115 was also a huge hit for kids (not haute cuisine, it is a tourist trap that young kids will love). Also the M &amp; M store, and walking around Times Square at night. Do the Top of the Rock instead of the Empire State Building - the lines at ESB are too painful even with an advanced ticket, and the Top of the Rock view is better. Definitely ride the subway, the best $2 amusement ride for kids there is."
Westin New York at Times Square,Mar 23 2009 ,Fabulous stay at the Westin NY at Times Square,"We stayed at The Westin NYC Times Square from December 21-24th, and had an amazing stay. Being a Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) was a great asset to our stay, as our room was upgraded and we had the most amazing views from our upper level corner room. We also were upgraded to Executive Club privileges, which greatly surprised us and made our stay that much more enjoyable. The room and bathroom were clean and elegant. The Westin Heavenly bed was truly that--especially after a long day of walking the city of New York! Though the weather was cold while we were there, we still took full advantage of staying in the heart of Times Square and walked everywhere for 3 days. The Westin's location cannot be beat--you are in walking distance from most tourist sites (and nearby to the TKTS booth, where you can get half-price show/theatre tix), yet the hotel is still quiet enough where you can relax. At night, our sleep was uninterrupted and we were blissfully ignorant of the honking horns and lights below. I recommend staying at the Westin for business or pleasure--it will surely be our choice when we return to NYC."
Westin New York at Times Square,Mar 22 2009 ,Good Location - Poor Service,"Spent 2 nights mid-week as my first visit to this property. There are some good and bad things about the Westin Times Square. Usually, one outweighs the other, but in this case, they pretty much balance each other out making for a very average experience - not necessarily what you expect from a Westin.The Good- The location is great for theater and business in the mid-town area. It sits at the corner of 43rd and 8th Ave, so it was very easy to take the express bus from Newark Airport which dropped me at 42nd &amp; 8th, a very short walk to the hotel.- The bed is very comfortable as is expected for the Westin Heavenly Bed experience- The overall look and feel of the hotel is fine. The Bad- The room was not cleaned during my 2 day stay. I even left a message for the hotel manager and never got a response- Check In was a mess, as was any need to speak with someone at the front desk. They have several stations for front desk attendants, but they chose to have only 2 working both times I needed to stop by &amp; they were spread out, so you really didn't know whether to form one line or stand behind the customers being helped. It made for some tense moments as those in the line that formed watched people just walk up behind the guests being helped and the attendants behind the desk didn't bother to advise them that a line had formed. - Took the separate elevator up to Shula's for breakfast. Waited in the bar/entry area for about 5 mins and nobody every came to seat me, so I left and found a restaurant off-site.- With a late check out granted based on my SPG status, they failed to advise that they would turn off my key at noon, even though they confirmed the 4pm check out...so as I went up at 15 til 4, the key wasn't working and I had to go back downstairs and wait in line again so they could correct the key. Not the end of the world, but inconvenient and inconsiderate of them not to advise me when I called the day prior to request the late check out. - It's probably best that the manager didn't bother calling me back as things just didn't improve during my stay. The rooms are a decent size - not large, not small. They have 42+ lcd TV's with a good assortment of channels. They bath was fairly small with just a tub/shower combo, not a separate shower.Overall, I don't rate this hotel very highly. I would stay again if I had points or found a VERY good rate. But it did not earn a return visit for any other reason than it was a pretty nice room in a good location, though with with poor service. If its the cheapest option in the area among those properties I would find acceptable (Hilton, Hilton Garden, Marriott, other Starwood property, etc), then I would go back."
Westin New York at Times Square,Mar 22 2009 ,Wonderful,"This was an incredibly speedy trip for business. 1 day. I arrived at 1pm, and left the next morning at 10am, but, it was lovely. Check in was speedy, courteous, and very friendly. The check in area was very visually pleasing. My room was ready at 1pm when I arrived, which was very appreciated. I was asked if I needed any extra pillows, and it was noted that my points were being updated, and asked if I needed help with evening plans. I even received a weather update. The room was very nice. I would have liked a nicer view, but, I wasn't in my room long. The bathroom was nice, the shower was nice. The bed was wonderful, and all was very clean. My luggage showed up quickly, as did my room service lunch. The food was good, and all the service was excellent. The location is wonderful also, very close to everything, and I would love to stay here again for pleasure or business. Check out was speedy, although I couldn't check out from my room, and the same gentleman checked me out as in, and commented that I may need a sweater if I was going out as it was a little chilly and raining. Altogether a lovely 1 day stay. I would recommend this to anyone, business or pleasure, families or not. Don't hesitate."
Westin New York at Times Square,Mar 20 2009 ,Fabulous hotel fabulous location!,"Had a fabulous 4 night stay in The Westin. Great location, very central for all Tmes Square amenities. Great staff, all helpful and friendly. Amazing beds, never slept so well! We were on the Executive Floor which meant we had complimentary breakfast - it was ok, but not a lot of choice. Rooms were very clean, bathroom was spotless and the shower was fantastic. Without a doubt would stay here again and I have already recommended the hotel to a friend who is going to stay in a few months time!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Mar 16 2009 ,bring a copy of your invoice otherwise very good,"Lovely central place to stay, however watch you are being charged correctly, we got a deal from their website, receptionist tried to charge us three different prices, all wrong when we arrived, other that that it was great. Beautiful flowers in the public areas. Amazing beds!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Mar 15 2009 ,Good solid choice in Midtown!,"Recently stayed five nights and enjoyed our stay for a few reasons. Really close to the #1 subway line @Times Sq. which just happened to take us really close to two of the things we really wanted to see in NYC...Statue of Liberty and The American Museum of Natural History. We were going to see the Lion King in the Minskoff Theater..again only two blocks away, also the hotel was relatively close to Carnegie Hall and Central Park. The rooms themselves were clean, updated and quite spacious. We had to stay an extra night due to a flight cancellation and got into a corner room, which we liked much better than the room we had the first 4 nights. We would definately stay here again. Really liked nearby restaurants as well...Becco,Carmines and Johns Pizzeria."
Westin New York at Times Square,Mar 9 2009 ,Absolutely Fantastic Hotel – Could not find fault !,"This trip was our second visit to the Westin. We got engaged in New York in 2008 and stayed in a top floor corner suite. When we booked to revisit one year later (Mar '09) we booked the same room type and the hotel very thoughtfully checked us into the same room. :)Views were amazing, staff are very helpful, location - couldn't be better !!I have no criticism on this hotel ... would recommend it to anyone that wants to be in the middle of it all. We would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel in our next trip to NY."
Westin New York at Times Square,Mar 7 2009 ,Great hotel in a great location with a great staff,"Me and my fiancee and two friends enjoyed our stay at the Westin big time. We were actually there the night the Giants won the Super Bowl so when we asked they upgraded us to a suite so it was more relaxing to watch the game. The rooms were completely renovated and were a nice size for NYC. They had two flat screen televisions, a very nice bathroom and a super cozy bed. The entire staff was great throughout our whole stay and we would definitely like to go back again. The location itself you cannot beat and it was only $199 for a weekend night."
Westin New York at Times Square,Mar 6 2009 ,Great stay...,Terrific location and a spotless room highlighted my stay this past week. Concierge service was excellent (we were looking for a cigar bar and they sent us to the best). Room on 29th floor was great with a nice view of Times Square. I slept with the blinds open to stare at the lights of Manhattan. I'll come back!
Westin New York at Times Square,Mar 2 2009 ,A memorable b'day - thanks Westin Times Square,"I recently celebrated my non-Leap Year birthday at the Westin Times Square. WOW! This hotel went out of its way! First, they gave me a corner deluxe room (I had paid for an upper floor prepaid room, but did not expect a corner room!) with fantastic views of the theatre district &amp; the Hudson, plus a sliver of the upper portion of the Empire State Building on the 42nd floor.Additionally, they sent a special birthday cake, most delicious surrounded by strawberries and blueberries, to my room while I was at the theatre. There was also a signed card. I really appreciate the kind and thoughtful gesture. I am not a Westin big spender, and I just did not expect this.The room had a wrap-around view as noted, and there was a nice Hudson view from the bathroom as well. Others have commented on the lack of shelf space but this was not a problem for me. There was a mobile etegere for additional storage, which should accommodate most guests' toiletries.I LOVED the fast, efficient check-in (please take note, Hilton Times Square!). No lines and I checked in at 3PM. This was a pleasant stay, and then some. I shall remember to stay here again. Great location, too - walking distance to the theater, subway, restaurants, drug store, etc,"
Westin New York at Times Square,Feb 27 2009,The Westin Hotel...Great Views,Stayed at the Westin 25th - 29th October 2008. We had a king size room on the 44th floor and had fantastic views even although a new skyscraper was being constructed opposite. It was an experience to lie in bed and look at the Empire State Building. The staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was spotless. My wife loved the heavenly bed but hey you are in New York so you are on the go all the time. Katrina sorted our booking and did us proud. We would not hesitate to return again and hope to next year. It was not cheap and the pound has dropped further against the dollar since we stayed but the hotel is in a great location to access the sights and sounds. We both felt very safe whilst out on the streets and the people were very friendly. We caught a flight into Newark and then the shuttle into the bus station which is opposite the hotel...great location
Westin New York at Times Square,Feb 26 2009 ,Best Hotel I ever stayed at!!!,"Before booking a long needed getaway for my girlfriend and I, we went through review after review, hotel after hotel, we decided to take a chance on the Westin in TImes Square. The pictures do it no justice, when you get there you will see for yourself, It is wonderful, great ambiance and appeal, you feel relaxed as soon as you get there. The rooms are nice size for NYC hotel. We had a corner suite, which for a little more is worth it. The view was incredible, 32inch LCD, dual head showers(which I never saw before, was awesome), very comfy bed, Ipod dock, cool design, no complaints at all, even the outside looks nice too.. The bar lounge inside was awesome, cozy, reasonable prices, don't know about the food, but I'm sure thats good too. The location is great, in the heart of Times Square, everything you need is right there, resturants, Ripley's museum(which is open till midnight which I found cool), Dave&amp;Busters, shops, Movie theatres (one actually connected to the hotel, another across the street)..I would recommend this to anyone and everyone that considers going to NYC..."
Westin New York at Times Square,Feb 25 2009 ,Okay but there are better hotels in the city,"My wife and stayed here for a night for Valentine's Day. The location in Times Square makes it very convenient and the westin heavenly bed is one of the better beds for the chain hotels. Check in and check out was a breeze and I would recommend this hotel only if you need to be in Times Square, otherwise there are better hotels in the city for the price."
Westin New York at Times Square,Feb 21 2009 ,Nice Location but location isn't everything,"Even though this hotel is one block from Times Sq, it isn't worth the money. The room is roomy for NYC but it was not clean and needed a good scrubbing because it smelt like smoke. The shower heads did not have enough power to wash way soap and shampoo. Room service trays were left on the corridors for over 24 hrs. Front desk personell were not friendly and not helpful, i was sent to the wrong room twice. Not worth the money"
Westin New York at Times Square,Feb 20 2009 ,over-rated over-priced indifferent staff,"The hotel is reasonably well located but is grossly over-priced. Stayed for five nights with my husband and 8 year old child. Not one member of staff greeted us or asked how we were at any time during the five days.On one occasion I used the hotel telephone to call a mobile number in Ireland. The call lasted 5 secinds as I left only a voice mail. The charge for this was $38 !!!!The concierge could not recommend a resteraunt for us to eat in!!!The staff were unhelpful and disinterested even when not busy.The rooms were in need of an overhaul especially the bathroom, as they were dated and dull.If you can find an alternative then do!! There are plenty of other similarly priced hotels in new york that are infinitely better. I would have moved hotel but was on a pre-paid voucher and had to stay put. I booked the hotel on the internet and got a reasonably good deal for the room, with two double beds for 5 nights of $1500.Would never stay there again,ever"
Westin New York at Times Square,Feb 18 2009 ,Faulty Towers,"I have stayed here 3 times and it has gone from OK to so inefficient it is a disgrace.I was in the hotel at the same time as SleepyEurope and as a business guest I concur with every criticism made. The Club Lounge was packed with kids to the point of complete discomforture. The food in the lounge is execrable and the continental breakfast is - breakfast cereals, youghurt, basic fruit and third rate bakery. For 2 days the The list"
Westin New York at Times Square,Feb 18 2009 ,A tired and expensive Westin hotel that needs help !!,"stayed 4 nights with family this week - have stayed at Westin Dubai recently also - far better....a few points - all the postive write ups seem to be from folk who stay on the very high floors and in the best rooms ! We hated the lobby on arrival with no directions to checkin - why is the conceirge not on the ground floor and why are there 4 staff loitering around doing nothing most of the day ? Room was ok but stainless steel washbasin reminded us of a kitchen not a chique hotel room - bathrooms were very small and had a sliding door which lacked privacy and was badly designed - the ice machine made noise all night out on our floor and the walls were paper thin - i hear people next door blowing their noses,showering,coughing and playing music (I think the noise also travels through the airvents in the bathrooms ---- the shower curtain smelt bad and needed replacing - me and my family NEVER saw any one of the staff smile in 4 days and the conceirge was helpful but the checkin staff were at best grumpy and all looked liked theyd had a bad day - every day ! the Club level was packed with families (we were one too) and the reception staff on the club level told us they served 350 people breakfast every morning over the holiday,valentines weekend - i felt sorry for the few business guys trying to hold meetings there.....familes bought in chinese,pizza takeaways and it smelt like a macdonalds not a sanctury for an evening drink - which you have to pay for !! ($5 bucks for beer or wine each)....the bars in the hotel only opened at 5pm (where can you have a cocktail at 4 30 ?) and there was a rush daily for the seats ! yes it was expensive and not very welcoming......Shulas is in the hotel but steaks go from $ 40&gt;&gt;&gt; up so with a family forget it !! the beds were comfortable but rooms cramped - eg the office chair for the desk actually blocked the room - so you had to remove it to get past the bed ! is that legal eg a fire hazard ? no free wifi in room which was a pain.I think the hotel is very busy and they get lots of customers but for me - wew wont be returning - its tired and worn out and all the staff were grumpy - it wasnt a welcoming hotel and needs a total overhaul of its layout,bars,restaurants and rooms.what a shame there is no sushi bar and a better bar? A missed opportunity by Westin."
Westin New York at Times Square,Feb 14 2009 ,Great hotel at reasonable price,"I stayed at the Westin Times Square for 3 nights at the end of January 2009 while on a business trip. The hotel is in a good location, within walking distance of the Port Authority terminal. The hotel rooms are on the upper floors of this tower, and my room was on the 32nd floor. The elevators are fast and I never had to wait more than one minute for one. Recently renovated, the room had a wonderful Heavenly Bed, a flat screen TV, and one sitting chair with ottoman. The desk was large (with a great working lamp) and the desk chair was extremely comfortable. There is a bar fridge in the closet and also a safe that is big enough to hold your laptop. The windows are well insulated and you don't hear much traffic noise -- a real plus in NYC!All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Room service was fast and most importantly flexible. It was possible to order things not on the menu -- something a lot of hotels won't do.My only complaint about the room is that it is on the small size -- fine for a single person travelling on business (as I was) but for couples there is not a lot of space to sit and relax. The bathroom is modern and the shower has a dual showerhead. There is not a lot of space around the sink to put toiletries, but there are some shelves on the wall. A hairdryer and bathrobe were in the bathroom.I will return to this hotel on all my trips to New York."
Westin New York at Times Square,Feb 13 2009 ,best hotel in New York,"great hotel fantastic location 100 yard from times square .Fantastic beds room amazing , Higher the better great views over midtown and beyond. Fantastic lifts service good hotel modern clean vibrant small bar was expensive but who wants to drink there ? Bathroom big robes heavenly. If you are looking at the top end of the new york hotel market you know already this is expensive 5* in my opinion because some hotels are living on the names and need a good kicking into life . This place has its own heartbeat and is very much alive. Shulas Restraunt on site beautiful top class food. B B Kings Blues Bar on site great club with great acts and very good food massive portions too.linked to eWalks large cinema bowling area is next door madame tussades over the road times square up the rd , Breakfast and bagels from anywhere you like all good and great for shops Central Park 15 mins ESB 15mins Macys MSG 15 mins Grand Central &amp; Chrysler Building 10 minutes Times Square and 42nd st tube 5 mins ALL THESE TIMES ARE WALKING"
Westin New York at Times Square,Feb 7 2009 ,Excellent Stay !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"We stayed here 25 Jan for 8 nights &amp; were 4 hours early on arrival but had a fantastic welcome &amp; no problem checking in early. After reading other reviews I asked for a high floor and were given a lovely room on the 45th with amazing views of the Hudson River to the left and a snapshot of Times Square to the right. Amazing!! We ate once in Shulas Restaurant &amp; yes it is expensive but you do get an amazing experience &amp; a fantastic meal. They're very ID conscious &amp; you need to show your hotel key to access entry after 11pm. The Hotel is in a great location, you can exit the lobby onto 42nd St right opposite Madame Tussauds with the Subway just on your doorstep. Take good walking shoes &amp; walk everywhere as it's easy &amp; fun. We took the subway &amp; ventured up to the Bronx Zoo, if you've got a day spare its really well worth it. Its HUGE &amp; the animals are amazing.......a truly great day out. They give away free tickets to the Late Show with David Letterman, so as it was raining &amp; freezing cold we decided to go along. WHAT A LAUGH!! Honestly, its well worth spending a few hours for the experience &amp; you get to meet some great people too. They film mid afternoon so you've got loads of time to get back to your room to even catch a glimpse of yourself in the audience. Real good fun!!!!!!!!!Of course we did all the usual shopping stuff visiting Bloomingdales &amp; Macy's which was fab as you'd expect. Visitors to the US should take their Passports to the Visitor Center in both as they give you a 11% discount card (Very handy) No trip no NY is complete without spending a day in Central Park, it never ceases to amaze me. Take a walk up to the Dakota Buildings &amp; spend a quiet hour in Strawberry Fields.We went back to Ground Zero &amp; walked down through Battery Park &amp; then up through Wall Street. Again, lots of walking but really enjoyable &amp; you get to see things you wouldn't on the bus trips. Also worth getting down to Greenwich village, get a cake from Rocco's, ah, to die for!!!!!!!!We were here for a week &amp; had a great time trying different restaurants out every night without any complaints. This was our third visit to NY &amp; by far the best. All in all it was a great stay at the Westin itself &amp; I'd definately stay here again.....Stroll on for the hext holiday !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 26 2009 ,Overall GREAT!,"We really enjoyed our stay and thought the Westin was a fab hotel, on first impressions the entrance very impressive. My husband and I stayed at the Westin for 5 nights in December 08 and absolutley loved it, we were on the 43rd floor and if you can get over the vertigo the view is amazing, the bed was very comfprtable. We never ate at Shulas the steakhouse in the hotel as there were just too many other places to try in New York, I also thought the basement restaurant location was a little claustrophbic and lacking in atmosphere. The christmas trees were lovely and the door men were nice and very helpful ! A word of warning though we ordered two glasses of the house red wine once in the bar and they were £10 EACH, I also was disapointed that the main bar area didnt open until the evening so if you wanted a drink in the afternoon you had to go to the basement and sit on one of the four chairs at the tiny bar in Shulas."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 25 2009 ,Great Experience on Business Trip,"This is a very nice Westin. I would say this would be ideal if you are traveling on business, or staying in Times Square is important to you. The hotel is modern and has a fresh and clean feel throughout. The gym is very nice for a hotel gym, with free weights, cardio, and even a Wii Fit console. There is not much in the way of food offerings at the hotel, but them Times Square is right outside. Sulla's is a nice restaurant, but a bit formal and old school given the rest of the hotel. Room service was very good, with the food being good and great service. There is internet connectivity throughout the hotel, although even though I paid in my room I couldn't get it to work in the lobby. The one thing I really didn't like was the business center, because to print a boarding pass they wanted to charge $7. This is ridiculous to me, since most hotels offer this as free, or the computers themselves are free at least for a little bit. But, this is a New York hotel. Finally, I will say that this is not a very family friendly option, as New York hotels go; for example, you need to take an escalator to the lobby, there is a lack of public and open space, and the hotel opts for modern and clean over comfortable."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 23 2009 ,Ny trip at the Westin,"I stayed at the Westin New York in December 2007 with my Mum, Aunt and two Cousins while on a christmas shopping trip.We loved the hotel and it's proximity to Times Sq/Theatre district. We stayed in a deluxe city view room on 41st floor, and had views over the Hudson. The standard of the room was brilliant, and the beds were soo comfy!! We loved the facilities available to us, including the spa, Shulas Steakhouse and the Starbucks Coffee and cinema in the basement. The staff were friendly and helpful, and provided us with a late check out room at no extra charge. The bell boy found us a private cab for our journey back to Newark Airport and negotiated a very reasonable price for us which we thought was fantastic. Overall, we had a fantastic trip and the Westin definitely made a lasting impression and enhanced our first experience of New York city!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 21 2009 ,Ok but pricey,"It's a great location and the staff were very friendly. However, face it, you are paying for location. The room was a little worn and the view (10th floor) was worth keeping the blinds closed for. So overall, not worth the $600 a night. Would stay elsewhere."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 15 2009 ,Fantastic Hotel!! Awesome Location!!,"We stayed at The Westin New York at Times Square for 5 fantastic nights from 16th Dec to 21st Dec 2008. From the second we stepped out of the taxi we were greeted and treated in a first class style! The bell boys took our bags and gave us tickets to hand in at the reception. At the reception desk we were welcomed by a very friendly and helpful receptionist who checked us in very quickly and gave us the good news that we had been upgraded!!! Off we went to the 39th floor to our room!! It was truely a room with a view!! A corner deluxe room with fantastic views over the Hudson River and also a view right up 8th avenue!! The room was really big for a New York hotel, queen size &quot;Heavenly bed&quot;, 32 inch LCD tv, loads of places to put our clothes, a starbucks coffee machine and a fantastic bathroom..........as read about on other reviews the &quot;Heavenly Double Showerhead&quot; was brilliant. The room was very clean with a contemporary decor. The bed really was &quot;Heavenly&quot; I wish I could have taken it home with me!!About 10 mins after getting into our room the bell boy brought up our bags and gave us some useful tips on navigating Manhattan including a great map! The location is very central and only 2 minutes walk from Times Square. The Port Authority bus station is almost opposite and you can get the subway from there all over Manhattan!Overall this was a top hotel and I wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anyone! I will definately stay at this hotel again if I get to come back to New York!!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 15 2009 ,Glad i read the reviews as the Westin was all i hoped.,"My girlfrend and i read lots of reviews on this site before choosing the Westin (as most people seemed to have a good time) and i write this today because like i did you are now desperately trying to decide which one to go for! Have no worries about the Westin it is a great place to stay. Staff were very friendly and we felt very safe. Got a room on 42nd floor which i think we paid top money for as we pre booked directly with the hotel @ $699 per night (it was my girlfrends birthday so i didn't want a crap room). Room was tidy allthough the extra money for a high storey room wasn't worth it as you forget everywhere else is the same height so we just looked mostly onto a half contructed hotel opposite allthough we did not get any problems with noise and you could see the city / river a bit. Worth doing the bus tours to try and get your bearings however be aware in traffic you are on for 3 hours. Uptown tour great / downtown tour a bit dull and too long. Take good shoes because you will do a lot of walking! Tried subway which was clean and safe. Streets also very safe as lots of police and even friendly people who will help if you ask the way! Best city in the world (puts London to shame). Broadway was great saw Liza at the palace (excellent) and chicago (had some poor reviews but we thought it was excellent also). In summary the Westin has a great location, its clean and friendly and the lifts are very fast. Book it and you wont be dissapointed! I live in Northumberland North east England. I have taken the time to write this to help others as they help me. Great site trip advisor, keep up the good work!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 13 2009 ,Nice hotel But a Little Confused,"The hotel is in an area that's good for tourists visiting Times Square (of course) but it has good business services like any Westin hotel. It was a new place and all the furnishings were in top shape. I wonder if many all-American tourists would really shell out to stay in the hotel at the rate they charge, or how many people with expense accounts would want to stay in the Times Square district. But if you can fit into either of those categories, it's a fine hotel. One thing that takes getting used to: the entrance isn't the lobby, it's an oddball parking valet and luggage check desk, so invariably you ask and get sent upstairs to check in. It's a confusing setup, and in New York the first thing you don't want to do when you arrive is lose sight of your baggage! What makes up for that is a cool factor: when I was there a bunch of limos pulled up for some NBA function."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 12 2009,Solid quality in central New York,"The most central location in New York, just off Times Square. Booked the room via the hotel website: 249 $ plux taxes, which is not bad. Asked for a room on a high floor, given one on the 34th floor; asked for a late check out, we were able to leave the room at 2 PM. Rooms not very exciting or elegant, and the bathroom is small, but overall a good choice in New York."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 9 2009 ,Great Location,"Quite a spectacular looking hotel from the outside.Room was clean and tidy, bed very comfortable ;-)Hotel staff were always courteous and helpfulMost impressive thing about the hotel has to be the location, about:3-4min walk to Broadway15-20min to Chrysler and Empire State Buildings20-30min walk to Central ParkOnly reason i have not give 5* is: hairdryer in room did not work, and was not replaced when reception were informed (didn't follow it up as we had taken our own), and only visited bar on 2 occasions, neither time was a bar person present."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 5 2009 ,Fantastic hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"We stayed at Westin for 6 nights on december!The hotel is so great!!!The location is absolutely perfect, just a block from Times Square, and with the subway just a few meters from the hotel.We had an standard room in the floor 29, with beautiful wiews of the city.The staff is friendly and ready to help. When we arrived they pick up our luggagge wich was sent quickly to our room.When we arrived at the room, I noticed (as I've read in other reviews) we didin't have the bath robe, but I called the desk and get one in a ninute.The room is big and plenty of space, with a big tv and a desk for working on the computer. The bath is also very confortable but what we loved more is the Heavenly bed! It is really Heavenly!! I've never slept so well in a hotel room, or even in my house, I want one in my house!!!The internet is a little bit expensive, but it worked very well.Also check in and check out were really fast!!I would recommend this hotel to everyone, because of its quality and its location, it's near evrything, specially if you like musicals, some of then are just a block from the hotel!!If you go to this hotel, I recommend you for breakfast Europan, wich its located next the hotel in the 8th ave, the food is absolutly great!!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 4 2009 ,Beware this hotel during vacation times,"There was a 30 min line to to check in. On a sold out New Years Eve they had two check in positions open and the other 7 were vacant. Told room not ready, came back two hours later. Nobody except front desk could tell us if the room was ready, so another 20 min wait in line. Told still not ready (2:30pm). Asked about how i would know when the room was ready. Front desk told me i would have to wait in line to find out. Room ready at 3:00pm when we arrived it smelled badly of smoke. Get ready for this, only way to change the room is wait in the 20 min line. What a joke. We booked an Executive Club room and the 8th floor lounge was like MacDonalds Playroom. Someone should tell these people that the evening snacks are not a dinner buffet for their kids. The lounge was packed with kids running around and the staff just smiled. and ignored them. The same at breakfast. The room was very nice though and the hotel is in a good location. At $650.00 per night I thought we could have a nice relaxing weekend. NW Toronto"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 4 2009 ,Great Post New Years mini-cation at the Westin Times Square,"We stayed at the Westin Times Square 01-01-09 thru 01-04-09. We had booked a “spectacular city view” corner room for $325 (including all taxes) through a special on the Starwoods site. We arrived at 3:30pm on 01-01 and were given a room on the 24th floor facing the Hudson River. It was a terrible view. We called to the front desk and were connected to the manager who explained with all the New Year’s celebrations there were a lot of late check outs. She asked if we could come back an hour later they’d have something ready higher up. We gave them our bags and went off to explore Times Square. When we returned we were given a corner room on the 34th floor. It had a much better view than the 24th floor and was on another corner of the property facing 8th Ave. We faced west towards the Hudson River, not east towards Times Square.It was windy and cold for the 3 days we were there. But it couldn’t have been a better mini-vacation to experience the energy of Manhattan. What I like most about the Westin chain is the consistency in their high quality beds. After walking for 3 days all over Manhattan, nothing was better than crashing in their heavenly beds. (I have a hard time sleeping in all hotels, except Westins. )The windows in these rooms also open about 2 inches at the bottom, so 34 floors up you could feel the energy of the city. When closed, the windows were amazing in keeping out the sirens and traffic from the street below. A very cool, and unique feature for a hotel in the city. There was even a building across the street under construction we couldn’t hear – and we’re noise Nazis….( in fact we had a terrible experience at the Westin Venice Europa/Regina). The staff was pretty much transparent, very much in the background, but always reading to help if we had any questions.This was my first overnight in NYC. We drove in from Maryland and came over in the Lincoln Tunnel which dropped up right to the hotel. Parking was $27 a night at the nearby Central Parking at 364 W 44th St.(with the hotel’s voucher) I was pleasantly surprised with the friendliness of everyone working in the restaurants, museums, taxi cabs and the hotel. NYC is not the mean city I had thought it would be. The Westin was near everything in Manhattan. The taxis were cheap, rarely over $8.50 – even to the Metropolitan and the Hayden Museums. We had great a breakfast and sushi at their sister property right on Times Square, the “W”, which is great for people watching. We had an insane dinner at their Shula’s Steak House in the Westin Times Square. I had twin lobster tails – the most tender and delicious lobster I’ve ever had. My wife had an awesome Porterhouse steak. This is a great hotel."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 4 2009 ,Hotel in the heart of Times Square,"Hotel located on 42nd Street, 8th Avenue just off Times Square. Paid 199$ a night plus taxes. Fantastic atmosphere to the hotel. Had a room on the 40th floor with excellent view of Empire State building. Room was comfortable and clean. We arrived at 9am and they did their best to accommodate us with a room. 1 minute walk away from the subway station. Try the Europa Cafe on the corner of Times Square for an excellent value for money breakfast."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 4 2009 ,Truly Excellent,My stay here was flawless. Price: I booked this on hotwire for under $200. I am an SPG gold card holder and got upgraded to the most fantastic room.Room: Perfectly clean and huge my NYC standards. Nice bathroom and good facilities.Service: Excellent
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 1 2009 ,Great Location,"Stayed for one night on 29th Dec. It has an entrance on 22nd and 23rd Street, just off Broadway. Our room wasn't ready but they upgraded us to a room with a jogging machine in the corner. I cant see who would use that after a day of walking round NY. Anyway, the staff were very helpful and allowed us to leave our bags while we went off for the day and said we could freshen up in the spa upstairs.We didn't eat there but the room was very clean and modern and fairly quiet considering it was probably ful. There are a few cafes just along the road for breakfast."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jan 1 2009 ,Awesome,"Stayed for five nights in October. We used points to upgrade to a corner room and it was worth it. Had a great view of the Hudson River and the USS Intrepid. Like always, the heavenly bed was as comfortable as they come. The room was clean and the shower had good pressure. I felt safe in the hotel and outside. There were dozens police officers throughout the area which was a good feeling. The hotel staff was helpful and professional. It was easy walking to the Gershwin, the subway is right outside the hotel, good restaurants all around and in the hotel. We used room service and it was very good. Starbucks in the room and a Starbucks in the hotel. We would definitely stay at the Westin Times Square again, overall it was fantastic."
Westin New York at Times Square,Dec 24 2008 ,loved it,"stayed here friday to monday 22nd dec .... first time at a westin great loacation so close to theatres and times square .... very quiet and peaceful hotel ... quite large room i thought larger than most london hotels ,,, good amenites ...starbucks coffee in room good tv ,i pod station etc , comfy new beds , smart modern looking decor my only gripe was it all had layer of dust on it and some furniture a little worn .... but not too bad ... we had room on the 20th floor nice views ...staff were always 100% ... i would stay here again no worries"
Westin New York at Times Square,Dec 24 2008 ,Great hotel in wonderful location,"We did a priceline bid and ended up with this hotel for a great price. what a great treat. We went to NYC for 2 nights and loved the location. The hotel was quiet, clean and so well situated. We walked everywhere (including Penn Station with bags). It amazed me how quiet the lobby and elevators were at such a busy time of year in the city. We would stay here again in a minute and truly were thrilled with the Priceline price."
Westin New York at Times Square,Dec 23 2008 ,Second visit to the Westin,"This was our second stay at the Westin. We're from the UK, and tagged this visit onto the end of a trip to Las Vegas to attend my sister's wedding. Due to someone thinking it was amusing [using my words advisedly here] to deliberately block the toilets with toilet paper on the aeroplane for our internal flight, we didn't arrive at the hotel until 3am in the morning. Despite our unintended late arrival, the receptionist was bright, breezy and efficient. We were on the 10th floor, not much of a view, but the room met our needs. Housekeeping didn't seem to be particularly generous this time with shower gels etc. Good job we had plenty of our own. Didn't have any meals at the hotel, so much choice around NY. Only had one drink in the bar, and it was more expensive than other bars we went to, however felt this hotel isn't particularly catering solely for the tourist end of the market, more a combination of tourists and business people.This was our third visit to NY. I like this hotel as it's central, the beds are comfortable and you have room service every day. I don't recall seeing any children there this time. I am a parent, but at my age don't particularly want to be around young children. Been there, done that. It seems more suited to business people or adult tourists."
Westin New York at Times Square,Dec 22 2008 ,A Wonderful stay,"Had a fab stay at the Westin. nothing is too much trouble here. On check in the staff saw that I had a baby and immediately offered to have a fridge sent up for milk etc and a crib for him too. The room was large and comfortable, with plenty of space for a family of four. the view from our room was incredible, as is the location of the hotel. the only down pooint was the price of everything in the hotel, e.g. to order a panini on room service came to over $40 inc tax, and drinks were very expensive in Bar 10. However the location of the hotel was perfect for finding alternative places to eat and drinkI would recommend the West way diner round the corner for a great breakfast!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Dec 21 2008 ,Can't wait to go back!,"My husband and I stayed at the Westin from December 11-14, 2008, and we were delighted with our choice. This hotel is down the street from the lights and sounds of times square itself, but it is a very short distance from that area. When we checked in the staff was polite and very helpful by giving us a map of the city at check in. We got to our room and was not surprised how small it was. If you're not used to New York City hotel rooms they are a bit small. We stayed in a traditional king room at about 310 square feet. It was perfect for us! We had reservations at Shula's steakhouse the same evening we arrived at the hotel and the food was fantastic! I would definitely recommend it. I also had room service while we were there and it was awesome too! We were able to walk to all of our destinations with no problems. It is about a 20 minute walk to Radio City Music Hall and all the action down in that area. We did have a lightbulb burn out in the bathroom and when we called the front desk to get it taken care of, the maintenance man was there in 3 minutes, yes I said 3 minutes. The staff was very impressive and I enjoyed the location. This hotel is one street over from several theaters, so if you plan on seeing a show this is a great location to stay. I also enjoyed the way the lobby was decorated for Christmas, understated but yet elegant. The service, comfortable beds, HDTV, and overall experience was great and I would highly recommend this property. Happy traveling!!!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Dec 16 2008 ,Love it!,"I have stayed in the Westin many times over the last 5 years &amp; LOVE the place. I have never had a problem with any part of the hotel. The members of staff are always happy to help. The Beds in the Westin are just FAB. The views are amazing, we could see the Empire State Building from our room, which made us all happy. We have eaten in the steak house in the hotel &amp; it was the best steak I have ever had!!! You are right next to Times Sq, so bang in the middle of it all!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Dec 15 2008 ,Honeymoon with a difference,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel, it is just off times square and we found it to have a quiet businesslike feel but overall a lovely stay. Especially seen as our room looked out down Times Square taking in Madame Tussaurds. The room was large and clean but maybe not as luxurious as I'd expected."
Westin New York at Times Square,Dec 6 2008 ,We keep coming back to the Westin,"The Westin is located close to a subway stop and is walking distance to Bryant Park, Rockefeller Center, and many theaters. The security at night is excellent, they check ID's before letting people inside. The rooms are very clean and some of the views are amazing. The beds at all of the Westin's are wonderful. This hotel is very quiet, which is a suprise in Times Square. Their customer service is very good. Over the past few years, we have had two situations occur, one involving a shipment, and the other a health problem, and they were very helpful. There is a Starbucks in the building, and a coffee machine in the room with Starbuck's coffee and tea. Although Times Square can be hectic, the Westin is a quiet haven. I have tried many other hotels, but have decided to stick with this Westin. I prefer it over the W hotels, seems newer and rooms are nicer."
Westin New York at Times Square,Dec 3 2008 ,Westin in the way to go,"I did my research so knew what to expect both good and bad. Most of the bad stuff did not really apply to me like the sink and mirror situation. When I first arrived at the hotel via Super Shuttle, I was dropped off at the corner. I had one bag and my back pack. I entered the ground floor lobby area through a turnstile doorway which was kind of tricky with luggage. I proceeded to the reception desk and checked in. I was offered a room upgrade on the top floor with an outstanding view of downtown and the Empire State Building. I could not ask for more. The room had all the usual Westin things like Starbucks Coffee, water bottles, glassware and fully stocked minibar. The only thing that was missing was the shampoo and conditioner so I called the Service Express number and three sets were sent up within ten minutes. There are two elevator banks. Elevator bank &quot;A&quot; is from floor 2-23 and elevator bank &quot;B&quot; is from 2-45. Since my room was on the 45th floor, I had to use the second bank. The Westin Club was located on the 8th floor were they provided breakfast and evening snacks daily. This was free due to my Starwood Status. You could gain access via the Club Level category rooms which are about $100 more than the other rooms. There is only one restaurant in the hotel. I did not eat here but did have a couple of drinks at their bar. the bar tendered, Brian, was very helpful and kind. There is also another bar next to the lobby, Bar 10, that is basically an extension to the lobby. It is closed off prior to noon which only leaves the small area in front of reception for people to sit. I personally did not like this option and think that both areas should be opened to the guests at all times. I have seen this in most Westin Hotels. The people working the Bell Desk did not seem overly friendly. But than again, I am in New York where friendliness is not a norm. If you had to choose a hotel in the Times Square area, this hotel would be a very good choice. It is close to everything and yet far enough away from all the noise that you would find closer to Broadway and 7th Avenue. The immediate area around the hotel is kind of tacky, but there are some good deli's, fast food and even a nice Jazz Bar around the corner. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it for singles or families. I guess on my next trip to the city, I will have to decide between the W Times Square and this hotel."
Westin New York at Times Square,Dec 2 2008 ,Another fabulous stay!,"The Westin is definately the hotel of choice when we go to NYC. The location is premium and the service exceptional. You are so close to the best of shopping and sightseeing that you would be foolish to stay elsewhere. My daughter and I are very finicky travelers, but the Westin was clean, comfortable and reasonable. The Asst. Front Office Manager went out of her way to make sure our stay was unsurpassed. I would highly recommend staying here for any planned visit to the city, you will not be disappointed."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 29 2008 ,Fantastic hotel - great views fab rooms and excellent location,"We stayed here for 5 nights mid Nov 08, the hotel is in a great location for all of the main attractions in New York and although it's on Times Sq as it's entance is just off the sq it's not noisy.We had a room on the 37th floor which looked out on to the Empire State building which was fab. Huge bed, super clean room, Starbucks coffee in room everyday, flat screen TV and marble bathroom with toiletries.I would definately recommend this hotel."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 26 2008 ,Great Value,"Our family with 13 year old daughter stayed at the Westin Nov 21-25 2008. I booked through bidding and got a very low rate. I arrived 1 hour before checkin, but they were very nice and gave me a room on a high floor with the 2 double beds we needed.We had the view out over the Hudson towards New Jersey and I really enjoyed the large window. the standard room was medium size for New York and nicely updated with a really good HD plasma television. The bathroom is very small, but newly remodeled and nice. I loved everything about this hotel. While we were staying there the Phoenix hockey team and Wayne Gretzky were staying and there was always buzz out front with fans waiting. Possible issues are that there is only one dining option inside the hotel - Shula's expensive steakhouse. You will need to go to Starbucks on bottom floor or outside hotel to eat, which really isn't a problem. Lobby isn't tremendously huge and splendid, but plenty of seating, if needed.Favorite meal was a light brunch at Sarabeth's on Central Park West."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 18 2008 ,Fab New Year !!!,"A great hotel just perfect for the excitement of New Year at Times Square.Very comfortable room with good view, tried room service breakfast on two days and it was great - just perfect for a relaxing start to a busy day of sightseeing.Woiuld definitely return again!! Can't wait."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 18 2008 ,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in,"The Westin was superb. A stones throw away from Times Square and all the main areas of New York.The hotel is beautifully laid out, and the room was very modern with everything you could possibly need. We had a great view over the river into Jersey.On the website they go on about you can buy a Westin bed - they are fantastic, if I could get one here I would.Nothing more to say - superb!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 12 2008 ,Great hotel and location,"I took my wife here for a romantic getaway for the weekend. This is a really nice hotel. We arrived really late after our flight was delayed and they checked us in quickly. A representative (and representative in training) showed us to our room and carried our luggage. Complementary internet, bottled water. Things I expect in an upscale hotel. We had a corner room with a nice view and a king bed. The room and bathroom were a nice size. I've heard that rooms at some hotels in NY are rather small. The location of the hotel could not be better. One block off Times Square and only a few blocks from some broadway theaters. I stayed here using Star Points. Before I decided to use Star Points, I was comparing prices of this hotel to others nearby and it's competitive and reasonable given the type of hotel and location. I hope to get back here."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 11 2008 ,We loved it!,"This hotel was really a treat for our trip. We stayed 4 nights in late October and had a fantastic stay. Check in was quick and easy, and we were given a standard king room on the 30th floor. The room wasn't anything huge, but definitely plenty of space. The hotel location was perfect, just a block from Times Square and all the action, which made it an easy walk whenever we wanted to eat, catch a subway (there is also a station right in front of the hotel), or go to a show. Pros:-Location, location, location-Friendly staff-Comfortable bed-Nice LCD tv (With real HD, not stretched out)-Huge bathroomCons:-Very expensive room service-Some street noise from sirens-Pricey internet in the business centerOverall we'd definitely recommend the Westin Times Square, and would plan to stay there again on our next trip to New York."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 6 2008 ,this hotel was perfect!,If you are looking for a nice clean modern hotel this is the one. This hotel is so conveniently placed for all the attractions that NY has to offer. The staff were so friendly and attentive. You can walk almost everywhere from this hotel. Lovely beds
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 4 2008,Terrible hotel stay away,"Location is quite poor, this hotel is not right on Times Square but on 8th avenue instead, across the street from a bunch of [--] shops.Room quality was average, nothing special, and the hotel's ambiance was terrible, reflecting the neighborhood that it really is in.Frankly I felt very unsafe walking around the neighborhood, I definitely wouldn't come here with a family for sure.Also the poor location means that taxis are almost impossible to come by; you're quite isolated.Stay away, there are a million better hotels in NYC at the same price level."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 4 2008 ,Solid but not spectacular,"I got a very good rate on this hotel recently for a 1-night stay. Keep in mind, that &quot;good rate&quot; is a relative term in NYC, but the rate was very fair. While there was nothing bad about my stay, this location didn't quite live up to the quality level and reputation of the fine Westin brand.On the plus side:-Great bedding, towels and amenities that are trademarks of Westin-Quiet room, with no noise bleeding through from halls.-Starbucks coffee, good in-room safe and nice quality televisions.-Polite reception by a very courteous, professional staff-Loved the &quot;double-headed showers!The minuses on this property are primarily in terms of building condition and design.-My room had a significant number of wall scratches, carpet stains, and little chips on furniture that simply didn't feel &quot;luxurious&quot;.-Some pretty hefty fees to use internet connections and weight room that discouraged me from trying either.-No robes in rooms, which is different from other Westin's I've stayed in.-a loose lamp fixture that was affixed to the wall. Again, not a life or death deal, just unbecoming a luxury business hotel.-Business center, which I only looked in, seemed incredibly crowded and squished.While I would definitely stay here again, as the beds, great location, and friendly staff make it a competent and comfortable night's stay, I just feel like this hotel can push itself a little to raise its &quot;true luxury&quot; reputation. A few new room furnishings and going through each room to make sure everything is fastened tight and all the t's are crossed would make a big difference."
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 3 2008 ,Well worth It!,Loved our stay here - we were on the 39th floor and had a fabulous view of 42nd St. The location is excellent - 1 min to Times Square but once you turn the corner you feel removed from the hustle &amp; bustle so it feels quite peaceful. If NYC could ever be described as that!The room was exactly as described and the beds do live up to the &quot;heavenly&quot; title. We tried Shulas and weren't disappointed - would recommend this hotel to anyone.
Westin New York at Times Square,Nov 2 2008 ,Just Perfect.....,"Myself and my parents visited this hotel for 5 nights to celebrate my Mothers 60th birthday. Everything about this hotel was just perfect.I contacted the hotel before hand to request a high corner room we immediately received a reply saying that we would both be upgraded to corner rooms with executive privileges!! This did not dissapoint the rooms were fabulous, the views incredible we had the Hudson on one side and the ESB on the other and the heavenly beds a joy to jump into after a day of sightseeing. When you wake at 4am for the first few mornings the sunrise is gorgeous over the skyscrapers.The executive lounge provided us with a quiet place to sit and chat about our day and plan the next. Here we were able to help ourselves to complimentary tasty hors d'oeuvres and soft drinks. we could also have beer or a glass of wine for $5 (much cheaper than the bar!) The breakfast was lovely, from porridge to bagels and fresh coffee and fruit juice.We were made to feel so welcome by every member of staff at this Hotel, check in was a breeze, all bar staff , housekeepers and the concierge warm and genuinely wanted us to have a great time. Hotels can easily provide clean comfortable rooms but this hotel did all the little things that make a difference; My mother received a bottle of prosecco and chocolate covered strawberries on arrival and then a bottle of champagne and strawberries on her birthday with a gift of a photo frame all wrapped beautifully. We purchased a cake elsewhere and the hotel stored it overnight and then provided us with a mini fridge for her room to keep the cake chilled. They also sent up a vase for her flowers within a few minutes of asking. We had late check out at 4pm and after this they said we could use the executive lounge until out taxi came a few hours later which allowed somewhere quiet to sit instead of the busy reception.The hotel was perfect for us in respect for location, I loved just walking out and being in the midst of the hustle and bustle, a few minutes from all the theatres, shops and take aways. We found a superb restaraunt a few blocks away on eighth avenue and 50th called Sosa Borella, lovely atmosphere and excellent food a couple of minutes from the Wintergarden theatre. We shopped (although not cheap anymore, some bargains such as Levis £22 from macy's) and took in two shows both excellent; Mama Mia and Haispray, we got the hairspray tickets half price two hours before from the TKTS booth under the red steps in times square, short queues as there are 12 booths and its a great place to take photos of the illuminations. Although Times Square never goes to sleep (we were shopping in Billabong at midnight) as soon as you enter your room you have complete silence.Great things we did; Top of the Rock, 3 hr Circle line cruise and ground zero museum which we booked before hand on their websites after reading the reviews on trip advisor 'things to do' its really worth reading those as our whole trip was full and went so smoothly. Took horse and carriage through central park on my mothers birthday, watched people iceskating in the sunshine. Took subway which was cheap, clean and much more spacious than the tube. Easy to navigate with very friendly people to help if you are not sure. Went on this up to bloomingdales and had lunch twice in a Diner opposite which was just lovely, the portions were huge! and service excellent. We felt completely safe at all times in New york.A great bonus was that we were able to watch the Northern lights on our flight home, something we will never forget.Overall the Westin was a perfect choice for us so thank you to all the staff there and especially to Maryann for making my Mothers special Birthday so memorable."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 31 2008 ,Complete Satisfaction!,"My family passed through New York on our way to a wedding, and we decided to spend one night in the Mid-town area to catch a Broadway show (Phantom of the Opera) to celebrate our wedding anniversary! (I know... didn't have a choice, we had to bring the kids with us...) We chose the Westin NY at Times Square mostly bacause of the overwhelming number of positive reviews at this site!Well, let me tell ya, they were well deserved, and I'll add our vote to the list! We had an amazingly satisfying experience! We do have a couple of nit-picks, which I will go into later, but they were insignificant in comparison to our overall positive impression of the hotel and its services.The hotel is ideally located for anyone who plans to visit Times Square and/or catch a Broadway show while in NY! (Is there any tourist/visitor who doesn't fit this profile?!) It's a small city block away from several major Broadway theaters, and one large block away from Times Square...close enough for an easy short stroll, even in a drizzle like we had, and far enough away to not be affected by the bright lights and loud noises! I think it took us 3 minutes to walk from the Westin to the theater for Phantom. Also, we had a rental car, but for guests who don't, there's a subway station right next to the hotel, and the Port Authority is 1 small block away! It can't get any more convenient!When I made our reservation, I had requested an early check-in and a room with 2 beds. So, upon our arrival in NY, I called the front desk to check on the room availability and was very pleasantly surprised that they had upgraded us to a corner deluxe king room!! Unfortunately, we couldn't take advantage of it because it only had 1 king bed... (It was my fault, I didn't change the default &quot;1 Adult&quot; when I made the reservation.) But, alas, the front desk clerk quickly found a room with 2 beds for us. The room wasn't cleaned yet, so we drove to the TKTS office to pick up our show tickets and had lunch before calling the hotel again. This time our room was ready! Even with the room change, we were still able to check-in about an hour before the standard 3 pm check-in, so it was early, just not as early as we had hoped. But, the front desk lady was very friendly and helpful in rearranging our rooms and apologizing for the delay!When we finally drove up to the hotel -- my first nit-pick -- none of the door men were friendly. They were efficient in unloading our car and welcomed us to the hotel, but it was spoken like a recording without warmth or even a smile. But everyone else at the hotel during our short stay were friendly, courteous and helpful! In fact, when we found out my daughter left her doll on the car, the bell boy, who was busy unloading luggages in our room, quickly called downstairs. Unfortunately, our car had already been driven away to an independent parking garage a block away. If we were to ask the garage to return the car, they would've charged us another $40 parking fee again!! So, the bell boy volunteered to show me the location of the garage. Thankfully, I was able to retrieve that #%@&amp;ing doll before all hell broke loose...Our room was located on the 40th floor with a huge window facing toward the Times Square direction!! What an amazing view of the city skyline!! We can even see the pedestrians and the neon lights of Times Square in between the buildings. But, it was surprisingly quiet because we're so high up. The street noises were very muffled and barely audible. As my wife said, we couldn't have asked for a better room location!!The room itself was very clean, modernly decorated and furnished. It was very spacious by NY standard. Even with kids and luggages, we didn't feel cramped. My wife loved the iPod dock on the stereo alarm unit! There is a big LCD TV, but we didn't try it because of our short stay and the Phantom show. Last, but not least, the 2 Westin Heavenly beds were soooooo comfortable that we just had to order one yesterday after we got back home!!!The bathroom was highly functional and roomy as well! My kids loved the 2 sprayer shower head! They thought it was the neatest thing. But, that brings up my 2nd nit-pick. The counter space in the bathroom was too limited and too shallow. My kids accidently tipped a bottle of lotion on the counter, and it fell into the toilet below. As many of you know how young kids are, sometimes they don't flush... Let's just say, it wasn't pleasant...Oh, the biggest surprise of our stay was the room service delivered a complementary bottle of champagne and 5 chocolate covered strawberries to help celebrate our anniversary!!! WOW! We were shocked!! My wife and I had to pick our jaws up from the floor when we found out!! Afterwards, we were giddy with that generous and considerate gesture!! (or, maybe it was the champagne that made us giddy...)Oh, oh, to top it off, I got an email from the hotel customer service apologizing for mixing up our room and not having it ready when we arrived into NY. As a gesture of their concern, they have credit my Starwood account with 5,000 points!! All I can say is what else can a hotel guest expect and ask for?!!! It's been one incredible experience of exceptional customer service! I must take my hat off to Maryanne, Westin's hotel manager, who have made our stay so special and memorable! I know where my family will stay in our future visits to NYC!!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 25 2008 ,wonderfull hotel,wonderfull hotel !!Excellent location just off times square.....Very clean and very comfortable beds....Rooms very modern in design and feel with famous signature heavenly beds and showers...Hotel is worthy of star rating....Would deff stay here again.
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 24 2008 ,Nice Stay,I had a sweet experience at Westin..Pros &amp; Cons:Pros:Great locationNeat roomsMovie theater inside the hotel!Cons:A bit expensiveBusiness lounge (for internet) closes at 10:00pmCheap breakfast
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 24 2008 ,Great hotel,"Another winner from Priceline. This hotel was very classy, the room was spacious, the king bed extremely comfortable, and the decor modern-attractive. The bath and shower products were especially pleasant. Ipod alarm clock/docking station was appreciated. The (free) umbrellas were great. The hotel is extremely convenient to subway, Port Authority, and Times Square. The hotel seemed like it would have been a great place to relax the day away had it not been for that business meeting. Acceptable pizza can be had after midnight 1 block away. Highly recommend."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 24 2008 ,miss it would go back,"my sister and close friend stayed there for nine wonderful nights. the room we stayed in had plenty of room for the three of us. i believe we were in the deluxe double. the room was very clean as was the entire hotel. the staff was very professional and polite. i had a chance to check out the spa which i loved, could have spent more time in there. if you would like a little frig for continous drinks and to put a few snacks/food in they will provide you with one. there is everything you need in this area, the night-life, liqour stores, comedy shows across the street, drug store, endless food, a movie theater, we took in SITC, great movie.. easy excess to everything.. oh yes the beds were heavenly.. i would recommend this to anyone as i haved been to nyc 3 times and this was my best stay. it was a little more cost wise but truely worth the little more that i paid. i miss the westin and can't wait to get back to enjoy fabulous new york city.."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 22 2008 ,Great Hotel!,"My wife and I checked in to the Westin New York last weekend and it really blew us away. The location of the hotel is ideal, since it is so close to Times Square, but the doors don't open directly into the massive crowds of people on Broadway. Considering the large size of the property, I was especially impressed with the quality of service. Check-in was a breeze, there was virtually no waiting at all. When I called the front desk from my room, someone picked up the phone immediately and was able to assist me. Housekeeping was attentive and did a great job. We were in a junior suite, which was a huge room by NYC hotel standards. Great views from our giant windows (which also kept the room nice and bright) and the room was also very quiet. The bathroom was cool and modern and everything was super clean and comfortable. We would definitely recommend this hotel over the other hotels in the TImes Square area."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 20 2008 ,Awesome experience... Breathtaking view from our room!!!!,"This hotel is wonderful... Not to mention the Staff!!! Very polite, courteous and profesional! When I mentionned it was my first time in NYC, she decided to give me the room with the BEST view... And I have to admit, it was!!!! I dont think I could of got any better. The room was big, clean and had everything I needed to complement my stay in Time Square. Conveniently located, this hotel is close to anything and everything!!! The only thing is the hotel's restaurant... WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!!! I dont see how they can justify 6$ for a small coffee... It ended up costing 60$ for ONE breakfast, for two... CRAZY!!! But beside that, I would stay there again without even thinking about it! :)"
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 18 2008 ,Brilliant location!,"This was a great hotel! Shula's steakhouse is in the lobby so the food is fantastic if expensive. The rooms were clean, and surprisingly spacious for Manhattan. I loved being right by Times Square as we were easily able to walk to most of our sights and the subway was close to get us everywhere else! The bed was yummy, exactly what you expect from a Westin hotel. I will definitely stay here next time we visit the Big Apple!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 18 2008 ,Great Location comfy beds,"Stayed here for 4 nights. The hotel is in a great location for Times Square. We had a King room which was excellent, large for NYC and with a huge comfortable bed which is what you need when you have been on a long flight and also after long days of sight seeing! Did not hear a thing from neighbours so we had a sound nights sleep, plus being on the 44th floor meant great views of the city and no street noise. The air conditioning worked very well and one of the quietest systems I have experienced recently. The room was very modern with everything you could expect (bathroom had 2 types of shower gel, conditioner, body lotion, sewing kits, shower caps, vanity kit and mouthwash). There is a coffee machine that brews Starbucks in the room which is great but to make a simple cup of tea was a challenge and they never provided enough creamer also the room service was expensive (but to be expected) but they were our only negatives. You pay a lot for an average hotel in NYC but not a lot more to get a high standard one so I would definately recommend this hotel.Concierge very helpful, was able to book top restaruants online and provide advice on how to travel around.Would recommend the Grayline sight seeing bus if you have not been before (done it twice now) and you get a discount by booking online before you travel. Don't forget to get your 11% discount card in Macy's!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 16 2008 ,Do not confuse the Westin with the Wynn or the Wyndham,"Do not confuse the Westin with the Wynn or Wyndhamhotels, the Westin is not as nice as the others. This hotelis located in the crowded Times Square area. I had hopedfor it to be a few blocks from the madness, but it is rightin the middle of it all....the tourists, the glitzy signage, andall...the hotel itself was nice but uninspiring....and overpriced.I was told that my room was a special upgrade with a viewof the city and river. It was nice but some of the details such assloppy workmanship (poor caulking in the bathroom, poor trim around the baseboard, cheesy table with worn velcro) and city smells inside were noticeable. I was a solo travelerand my room rate was $429 per night plus tax, so for onlytwo nights my cost was just over $1000! The internet chargeis about $18 per night, or you can pay as you go in their business center off the lobby starting at $6.95 for 15 minutes.If you like being in the middle of the craziness, just one block from Times Square and one block from the Port Authority, then this hotel is for you. The hotel restaurant, Shula's, is famous for their steak (minimum $55) and also serves an expensivebreakfast and lunch. Their are plenty of reasonably priced cafes and walk in restaurants (Cafe Europa, Ben &amp; Jerry's) nearby.I also stayed at the Hilton Mid-town, 1335 Ave of the Americas,during this trip, and I believe it is a better value than the Westin($100 cheaper per night, great location, better service, beautifulrooms on the 33rd floor, wonderful quality inside air for a city hotel)."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 11 2008 ,Excellent,"Excellet hotel, with an excellent location, amaizing views from its rooms. It is a moderm bulding, rooms are small, like an another hotels in the area, but with every thing you need for a business/pleasure trip. Be carefull with the man in the door, he accepts tips from the taxi drivers, and then the taxi drivers give you a round to go to the airport.People in reception was correct."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 10 2008 ,Do Not Stay Here,"We recently stayed at this hotel in times square for three nights. The room was ok, the bathroom was bad with a pocket door that did not close. On our last night, we woke up at 3 AM to a loud crash coming from the room next door and a woman screaming at the top of her lungs. We called the front desk and they said they would send someone up. This smashing and screaming went on until 5 AM. After my third call to the desk, things got quiet again, but we only had one hour left at that point, since we had to catch a plane. I know the hotel cannot control the behavior of their guests, but this was out of control and they should have been removed much sooner than they were. But that's not even close to the worst of it. When I got my AMEX bill, I found that they charged us for TWO rooms! When I called to have them remove the charge, they said it was a nonrefundable rate. Can you believe it? They made a mistake and want me to pay over a thousand dollars for it and they only have one response: &quot;I'm sorry, but it's a nonrefundable room rate.&quot; No matter what I say, they do not hear me. I have never had a problem in any hotel before, ever, so I just had to write about it."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 9 2008 ,Fantastic Location,"Hotel was fab - our stay was for our honeymoon we stayed 7 nights, our room was upgraded and we received a bottle of wine and a cheese board on the house on the 1st night which was a lovely gesture and a surprise. The room was spacious with fantastic views of the empire state building, the hotel e walk is fab - starbucks and a cinema etc. The hotel is perfect for getting to any location - we walked most places and found them all very close to the hotel - the nearest to the hotel been Times Square.The hotel staff were all very friendly and the hotel is very new and clean.I would definately recommend this hotel and hope to stay in NY again in the future. Best holiday ever!!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 6 2008,Family friendly superb location.,"Great choice of Hotel. Excellent location, friendly staff and great Concierge. Was able to check in on arrival early am, and the reception staff went out of there way to offer an alternative lower floor, but we held out for our booked room type on the 35th floor. Smallish size room with two double beds and excellent views of Times Square and the Empire State Building. Hardly any noise. Beds were bliss. Travelling with a 2 year old, I liked the kids pack (including night light, socket covers and plasters etc.,. Would recommend that bed guards for Children are pre booked as none available during our stay. Toiletries in bathroom a little limited,(no shower caps, earbuds) but powerful hairdryer. Hotel services a little pricey but typical of a 5 star. Good deli right next to hotel for cheaper food and supermarket across the road. Overall brilliant stay. Would recommend and would revisit."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 4 2008,Great hotel with central location!,Wonderful staff. Got a free upgrade to a spa-inspired room. Decent size rooms-very clean and nice bathrooms. Loved the beds-were wonderful to get into after a long tiring day. Massaging chair in the room did a great job in relaxing sore muscles! We had an amazing time there. Would recommend this place to everyone!
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 4 2008 ,Good Location for Broadway Shows,"This is a high rise luxury hotel in the heart of times square. Service is excellent. Rooms are pricier than the neighboring Marriott but it is worlds apart. First, its smaller and quieter. Rooms are small by national standards but average for NYC. I stayed in a larger corner deluxe room which has excellent views. Club floor rooms are the same but include the lounge which had a decent cold breakfast and evening munchies. Bar is cash but drinks are only 5 dollars. Lounge includes access to gym which is on the 23rd floor and looks out over the Hudson river--very striking view. hotel staff are very attentive and friendly. They have a separate Tour-Show concierge from the regular concierge. Bar in the lobby is sleek and very trendy NYC. Attached to the hotel is Chevys which has very good mexican food (go thru exit next to business center). Hotel also gave up on charging for internet to print boarding passes--its free finally in the bus center. Location is the best feature--right in the theater district. Growing up in NY, I always hated getting out of a show at 11 PM and my parents cursing trying to hail a cab. Stay here and you have no more than a 2 to 4 block walk. Very classy, business oriented hotel but you will pay for it."
Westin New York at Times Square,Oct 1 2008,A Fantastic Modern Hotel a Few Steps from Times Square,"The Westin Hotel is known for pampering, and I can't tell you how thrilled I was to experience this! The hotel rooms are comfortable, with the Heavenly beds the best thing of all! The two Heavenly shower heads made you want to stay under the water forever. After walking all over the City, it was a treat just to get back to our room and relax in the plushness of the bed. The staff were all friendly, and the bell desk was the most efficient and helpful of all. I can't wait to stay another night at the Westin!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 30 2008 ,Best in Times Square,"I've stayed at this hotel so many times I can't even count. And every time I do I'm not disappointed. It is by far the best hotel in Times Square and probably my favorite place to stay in NYC. I'm surprised that other reviewers would have anything negative to say about this place because I have never had a bad experience here. Everything from the lobby, to the rooms, to the service, to the location is ideal in my opinion. Firstly, the rooms are about as big as you'll find anywhere in the city. The heavenly beds are incredibly comfortable and despite the fact that the hotel is just about a block away from the center of Times Square, I can't recall ever really noticing the noise from outside. The bathrooms are very clean, modern, and contemporary and I absolutely love the heavenly shower.The location is also ideal being just a block away from the middle of everything in Times Square but equally conveniently located less than a block from the Port Authority bus terminal and right across the street from the entrance to the Subway. No matter how you come into the city it's easy to get to the Westin via public transportation.I also happen to love the cocktail bar off of the lobby. They have a great martini menu and also have a light food menu... a perfect place to start an evening. I've also heard really good things about the steak house Shula's (although I'm not a big red meat eater myself).The concierge has always been very helpful in suggesting places to eat nearby and the front desk staff has also always been very accommodating in allow us to check-in early when rooms are available.One thing to watch for is when they offer weekend discounted room rates via the Starwood website. Every once and awhile you can get a room here for $199/night-- which is a bargain for the area. I probably wouldn't ever pay over $299 to stay here (or anywhere for that matter) but when I see a great rate pop-up I'm always first to snatch it up. Overall I can't see one thing to fault in this hotel. Every time I try another hotel in the area I'm reminded of why I love this one so much. I will definitely be coming back again and again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 26 2008 ,Cold sterile uncourteous,"In TripA, this hotel is voted the 77th best hotel in NYC. I think that's generous. Typical, not charming. American corporate chain hotel. The location is not great, the rooms very basic for the price, the room service slooow. Go somewhere else,"
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 25 2008 ,great hotel choice for NYC,"So I have stayed at lots of hotels in NYC - and I love this hotel. I booked the day before I needed to check in, and got a great rate. Some hotels will screw you when you book cheaper rates - but I got a great corner room with a view. They even let me check in early, which a lot of hotels in NYC don't let you do...Some pros of this hotel- Location is excellent for times square, and very walkable to central park, empire state building, etc.- Beds are outrageously comfortable. Outrageous. You will want to buy one when you leave. I did!- Great shower- Very good toiletries- Twice the size of many similar-priced NYC hotel rooms. Sitting area near the window, large desk, etc.- Great view from the upper floors- Staff is polite and super helpful - rare for NYC as well- Bathroom is clean and spacious- Nice flat panel TVs in the rooms- Near tons of restaurants and bars, as well as small grocery stores to get water, etc- ipod docking stationI have to come up with a couple cons- Not a ton of counter space in the bathroom - makes it hard to maneuver- This is a giant hotel that seems to get lots of groups - so the lobby can be sort of a zoo sometimesLove this hotel! I find myself trying to find ways to come back!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 24 2008 ,Great place to stay,"I've stayed at the Westin for several times now, and I have never had a bad experience here. The rooms are always very nice, the heavenly bed always a delight, and the showers lovely. It's a great place to stay if you're visiting the city, and you can usually get some good deals on it, especially if you're a Starwoods hotels member. The spa there opened recently, within the past year, and I tried it out on my last visit there. Although not as fancy or big as some other places, the masseuse was very professional, and it was actually one of the best massages I have gotten. I stayed in a junior suite on one of the upper floors, and the views are amazing. The Westin is definitely a great find, as there are usually good deals on it. Location is great."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 22 2008 ,Very good overall but expensive,"Spent one night at the Westin as a family in July 2008. We paid full price (&gt; $400 / night) but were given a room on the top floor (45th) with an amazing city view.Pros:- great location, just close enough to Times Square but not right in the madness of it- friendly welcome at the reception (they even spoke some french with us which was a nice touch)- super view on Times Square (+ Empire State bldng)- windows that actually open - steps to the theaters- fast and efficient elevators Cons:-Boutiquish look and feel, a bit too cold and trendy for our taste- too business like- weird and inconvenient bathroom- weak air conditioningWe would go back but only if given a lower special rate."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 22 2008 ,Okay stay at the Westin,"We had an average stay at the Westin. It certainly doesn't feel like a high-class five star hotel but neither is it disappointing. The lobby is attractive and the beds were huge (we had a king), with a well-appointed bathroom. But the view we had was pretty dull and the paper was slightly peeling off the walls. The lamps were also not put together properly and rattlesdwhen you turned them on. A bit more attention to detail would vastly improve this hotel. I wouldn't pay $500 a night for this Westin but there are some good deals on the hotel website, so check those out."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 20 2008 ,Best hotel ever,This is the best hotel I have stayed at it were just a shame it were only for the weekend but i will be staying again next time i visit the big apple. The staff were very helpful and nice not at all rude like some other reviews made out.The rooms were huge and the beds are the best beds in the world there to die for very good for chilling out in after having a hard day at the shops and sights.Also the room were very clean and were always done by the time we returned in the late afternoon.We did not eat at the hotel but the menu looked good but we did have a night cap at the hotel bar. Once again this was the best hotel we have stayed at thank you to all the staff at westin hope to be back soon.
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 19 2008 ,Would Never Recommend This Hotel!,"Our stay was a prepaid gift, but the desk people required a credit card from us on arrival, &quot;for incidentals.&quot; Of course, our credit card was billed for the entire amount -- a discounted rate that, in our fairly sophisticated opinion, was too high anyway. We and our benefactor had to make many calls and provide several copies of the prepaid booking, to try and straighten the situation out, and after a week, we think we may be making progress. Unlike some reviewers, we found only some of the staff to be rude. Most of the people we have dealt with have just been clueless. No one seems empowered to make a customer-oriented decision. After an average room, average service, and a very substandard billing experience, we would advise other travelers to go elsewhere."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 18 2008 ,Sleek Oasis in Crazy Town,"I love a good value, so when I saw a $199/nite rate for the Westin over labor day weekend, I couldn't pass it up. My friends and I stayed 4 nights, and I didn't want to leave afterwards. I took the Airtrain and subway into Manhattan from JFK (it's the cheapest way into town and not that difficult at $7/person), and after all the travel, the Westin was like a shining beacon of sleek comfort when i popped out of the subway at 43rd and 8th. What's not to love about the Westin? Location was super convenient to various subway lines, short walk to theatres, the madness of times square, less than a mile to Bloomingdales after passing Rockefeller Center...but I digress. The service and attitude of the staff was pretty good for New York City. I got the best tips for good local eats from the bell staff. If you have access to the executive club (platinum SPG) you can enjoy their complimentary breakfast each day. While not the grandest spread, it was decent. The lox was really good...but they ran out of bagels each day. I wished there was more hot food on offer (aside from the oatmeal). But can't really complain.The bed and shower was great.The only odd thing was the Apple PC they had in the room. I'm not a Mac person, and the wireless mouse was dead, so I couldn't figure out the keyboard shortcut controls for the thing when i was trying to use it. I ended up leaving it powered on because I didn't know how to shut it down....and putting a towel over the monitor to try to squelch the light in the night. Westin: maybe you can leave the guest some simple shortcut instructions in the event another user has the same Mac-illiterate experiences.Oh, and is there any way you can turn up the lighting in the hallway, so that when getting ready for a night out, I can get a better look at myself? Yes, I know, vain. But really I'd love to stay there again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 8 2008 ,Great hotel for sightseeing base,We used this as a base for 4 days in NYC on our honeymoon. We were not in the hotel much hence why we had chosen what is more of a nice business hotel than a personable hotel. Couldn't fault the hotel though. The cold breakfast we received as a result of an upgraded room was great and saved us time in the mornings. Room was huge but terrible view. Excellent location for the main sights.
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 7 2008 ,Tranquility in the middle of the Manhattan Jungle,"I stayed one Saturday night at Westin Times Square with my sister and mom for my sister's 30th birthday. I chose this hotel because the Hilton was not available, and we needed to stay somewhere close to both Port Authority terminal and the Schoenfeld theatre for our show that evening. We arrived prior to noon and our room was not available. We left our bags with the bellman, left the hotel, and returned after 3:00pm, the hotel's check-in time. There was somewhat of a delay in getting our room, with the front desk clerk needing to check with a supervisor, but ultimately we were given a room with 2 double beds on a high floor overlooking 8th avenue, as I had requested in my initial reservation (I am a Starwood Preferred Guest member). The room was not as small as I had expected. The bathroom had a tub/shower combo, small sink and commode, closed with a frosted pocket door. The closet contained the coffee maker, fridge and safe. The two double beds had a single nightstand between, but there was room for a desk, chair and lounge chair as well. Flat screen TV. I love the Westin's heavenly bed, and we were able to get a good night's rest. Street noise was minimal despite being on the Port Authority side of the building. We were high enough up to overlook the river and New Jersey. It was peaceful to look out over the city on Sunday morning. The window in the room actually opened for those of you who like fresh, city air. Overall the room was neat and clean. On par with Westin standards. The lobby was in classic Westin decor -- peaceful tones, spotlessly clean, pleasant scent and comfortable seating. Our guest room was pleasantly decorated in Westin's new modern look. Traveler's pictures accurately depict it. Service was good. I asked for a birthday cake for my sister and they delivered it when we returned from the show. Despite the wait, check-in and check-out were smooth. I had to correct the room rate at check-out, but this was done with pleasantly and without incident. Our rate included in-room breakfast, which was delicious, fresh and up to Westin's standards. Bell staff were eager to help and hail a cab. Overall, the hotel had the tranquil, upscale ambience makes you feel relaxed and welcomed the minute you enter the hotel. I would choose this hotel again for my Manhattan hotel needs and would recommend it without hesitation."
Westin New York at Times Square,Sep 1 2008 ,Will return to the Westin Times Square,"Our family stayed at the Westin Times Square 8/27 to 8/30 . We are Starwood gold members and were upgraded to a &quot;VIP&quot; room. I assume VIP means upper floors, as my wife and daughter had stayed there once before in a larger corner, non &quot;VIP&quot; room. However, I do recommend getting an upper level room if possible as the room was very quiet, and we could hear very little city noise. Overall, the room was small, but this is probably to be expected in NYC. However it was comfortable with the heavenly beds and dual showhead we've come to expect with Westin hotels. I would add that there is very little counter space in the bathroom. The location is very convenient to Times Square and Broadway theatres. All the staff we encountered were courteous, friendly and helpful. Our plan is to stay here again on our next visit to NYC."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 31 2008 ,Fantasic Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Westin New York Times Square for 5 days at the end of August. This is our 3rd trip to NYC. We got a fantastic deal online and I have to say I was a bit worried because I thought maybe the deal was too good! We arrived early and checked our bags in, no problems there. Check-in was smooth. When we walked in our room, I was so greatly relieved ....... it was absolutely FANTASTIC! We had a beautiful riverview, everything was bright and clean. During our whole stay we had great housekeeping service and the location is sooooo central! I would absolutely, positively stay here again and will the very next time I visit NYC!TIPS: Great pizza place one block over (I think on 44th), John's Pizzeria, also Junior's (I think on 45th) was a great place/good value, wonderful cheesecake (I had the carrot cake cheesecake, so good!!!!). We also bought the CityPass, which is a really good deal if you are planning to do the things that are included with it."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 30 2008 ,Peaceful Stay in a Hectic Location,"My girlfriend and I have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Westin at Times Square and cannot complain about the service received or the room itself.Reception Staff - very helpful indeed. For all those visitors using Travellers Cheques, they do not charge to exchange them.Room - Asked for a high room with a view and although not looking at any stand-out feature of NYC, the view was good. The room and bathroom was always clean and tidy. The bed is very comfortable after a long hard day walking and we found there was adequate bathroom space for toiletries, etc. We were advised the minibar was sensitive to movement so don't be too tempted to see what is in there. If travelling from Europe, dont take your hairdryer as they are not as powerful when used in the US plug sockets (as my girlfriend found out!).Only downside was the constant reminder for tips from the baggage handlers and the guys on the front door. We appreciate they make their wages up with tips but do not think the constant reminders are required. Not the best location for food - unless you want fast food but for breakfast there are plenty of coffee shops and other bakeries selling croissants, muffins, etc. (PAX opposite Madame Tussauds is good).If getting a yellow cab back to the hotel, just tell them near the Port Authority Building as not one taxi driver knew where the Westin was!Trip Tips - Do Top Of The Rock at dusk and watch the sunset (we would advise you give it a day or two (if you can) just so you can work out what time the sun sets and then go up after you know). The Grayline bus tours were good (uptown, downtown and the night tour) but felt it became a broadway audition from the 'wannabe actor' guides at times rather than them telling you points of interest (although we did get one older guide who was very informative) and again with the constant tip reminders. We would advise you to prebook your tickets for the Statue of Liberty and get there early to avoid the queues. If there are any students in your party take your student cards if you are going to any of the museums for a slight discount. Use the subway as its fast, cheap and not as scary as you may think. Used Grand Central to get to Bloomingdales and the Brooklyn bridge and both stops bring you out right next to them.Would stay at the hotel again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 30 2008 ,Fantastic views and location,"My husband and I stayed at the Westin Times Square for 5 nights at the end of last year (sorry for the late review!) and we were really pleased with our choice.We picked the hotel predominately for the location and because I do tend to favour hotels with modern, fresh decor and clean lines. The Westin ticked the boxes on both counts and so we were confident that we would have an enjoyable stay. After reading Trip Advisor reviews on which rooms tended to have the best views, we asked our travel agent to book us in a corner room and to request a room on a high floor which ended in the number 39. We knew it was a might be a bit of a tall order bearing in mind the size of the hotel and the amount of guests staying there at any one time so we really didn't have massively high expectations of the request being granted. When we arrived at the hotel, check in was very smooth and found the staff to be pleasant. Sure enough, we were given room 4439 and we were absolutely delighted.We made our way up to the room in the ear popping speedy lift and when we opened the door, we were both astounded. The back wall was just a bank of windows and the views were spectacular. To the right, was the Hudson River. Straight ahead was the Empire State Building and we could actually see all the way down to the tip of Lower Manhattan and to our left was Times Square. I couldn't imagine a more exciting and amazing view! I was so pleased about it that I went back down to the reception and thanked the lady who checked us in. She looked ever so pleased and beamed back at me when I told her how thrilled I was! As for the room itself, it was a good size although the bathroom was a little tight. I probably could have done with more counter space in there! The double headed shower (which I think is called Westin Heavenly shower) was divine though. I'm a shower person and I loved it. The pressure, especially considering how high we were up, was excellent as were the different settings. The bed was lovely and comfortable, the room was furnished very nicely and was immaculately clean. The nice, modern touches of an HDTV and iPod docking station finished the room off well. We found there was plenty of wardrobe (closet) space, and we were happy to have an in-room safe and coffee maker in the room as they are always standard requirements for us. The complimentary mineral water was also really great after a long day shopping!!We didn't eat in any of the hotel restaurants because there is such a vast choice in Manhattan. We did find the Starbucks attached to the hotel very handy! We also went to the cinema that is attached which was also great.The biggest plus for the hotel is obviously the location. It took just a couple of minutes to walk to Times Square and Fifth Avenue and Macy's were about 15 minutes or so either way. Everywhere felt like it was within easy reach and there was a Subway station just a couple of minutes away.The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is that the bathroom was on the small side (although that's not really unusual for New York) and the strange lack of a blackout blind on the window looking over to Times Square. Although we expected there to be lots going on outside (although we weren't affected by noise at all and found it to be very quiet), we only had a curtain which was almost sheer hanging on that window. We didn't know if there was a blind missing or if it was the way it was designed but it was pretty offputting having a flashing screen going on at 3am with no way to block it out!All in all, a very nice stay at the Westin and we would definitely consider staying there again next time we go to New York."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 29 2008 ,Great central hotel,"We booked this hotel in January on a special Expedia deal - 40% discount and arrived on a very hot, busy August Saturday afternoon having travelled from Cape Cod. The hotel was everything we hoped for and there were 10 of us - 6 children and 4 adults. We were upgraded to Club Rooms and were very pleased with both the accommodation and the service we were given. The rooms were clean and well appointed.The location was brilliant once you worked out Times Square and that if you went out of the back entrance you were somewhere very different from the front entrance! We had a great time, with the hotel as a much needed oasis and would definitely stay there again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 28 2008 ,Nice hotel - pricey but average for NYC I guess,"We wanted a mid-town NYC hotel that wouldn't smash the piggy bank. Got a &quot;deal&quot; on hotels.com which (after taxes etc, etc...etc) worked out at just under $400/night.Ok...so that's a lot of green for a hotel. So you'd be entitled to expect a lot, right ? Well, if you discount the fact that $400 for a hotel room is ridiculous in any language, or in any town, then I guess you could say we got our money's worth.The location (1 block off Times Sq) was fantastic. The lobby/bell hop/concierge service was friendly, informal and first rate, The room was modern, clean and very nice - it was also a Normal 'normal' size, not a NYC normal size.Restaurant/bar prices were ridiculous, but no worse than anywhere else in NY.The place exuded a sense of understated class. Not too 'in your face' upscale - especially for a Manhattan hotel.. It felt comfortable, classy and friendly....until you saw that $$ number on the checkout invoice..Yikes - Orlando next year !"
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 28 2008 ,Good location,"I stayed at the Westin for 5 nights at the end of a month long trip throughout North America. I was generally happy with the hotel in the end, although my initial check-in experience was terrible.The lady at the front desk was extremely rude. I was two hours early for check-in and realised I would probably be unable to go straight to my room however she was exceptionally dismissive and almost annoyed that I had dared show up early (unavoidable due to flight times). As it was my first trip to New York I went to the concierge to see if I could get a map and some pointers to walk around until I could come back and check-in. Again I was faced with a rude and unhelpful staff member.However, that said this was my only complaint. By the time I returned there were new staff on the front desk and the gentleman could not have been more helpful or polite. I settled right in and was very happy with my room which was very large and had an extremely comfortable bed. I was very happy with the lobby bar, which had excellent staff and a nice atmosphere. It was clean with very fast elevators and I am a big fan of the in-room coffee machine.Obviously it is in a good location for broadway shows and plenty of tourist action. I managed to get a very good price on the room so it was definitely worth it and I would stay again and recommend it, however had I paid more, the intital check-in experience would have definitely turned me off from returning."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 26 2008 ,Good midtown location spotty service,"When we booked through the spg program six months in advance we requested a king bed on a high level floor with a view. They granted part of that request, but unfortunately the view was not great. As you have undoubtedly read, the hotel is located a block from the garish Timesquare, which has its pluses and minuses. One downside is that there are few close local choices for dining; mostly chains instead. And there are crowds of people everywhere, which gets a bit old after a day or so. But transportation is never a problem and being close to most of the subway lines is a definite plus that should not be overlooked.Our room was nice and standard Westin quality. The bathroom was too clinical looking for my taste and there was not adequate counter space. But there were other shelves in the bathroom to use for storage. Contrary to one previous reviewer, I appreciated the cardboard Starwood coffee cups, which made it easy to grab coffee to go. Upon return late one afternoon, we found our room door partly ajar. Housekeeping had apparently forgotten to close it. The room was also not cleaned, made obvious by the still unmade bed. It was as though housekeeping had come in and then left right away (after taking the tip money we left out). We did a quick inventory of personal belongings of value in the room and did not find anything missing.Speaking of housekeeping, we would hang our towels up after using them, with the intention of using them one more time before changing them for fresh ones, and housekeeping would change them anyway. One day we left the dirty towels on the bathroom floor to indicate they needed changing, and we received no clean towels. Housekeeping overall seemed to be inconsistent, but minor inconveniences that were solved by a quick phone call to the service desk.I didn’t understand why this hotel charged for use of the fitness center but I’ve stayed in other Westins that have not. This is a confusing policy. We ran in Central Park instead of using the treadmills, which was a must-do experience for any runner who visits NYC, but it would have been nice to have complimentary use of the fitness center.Overall, the hotel was pleasant and a nice retreat from a long day of siteseeing and shopping. For a good rate I would probably stay again, but would hope for a view the next time around. However, there was nothing that made our stay spectacular, so if you’re looking for someplace really special, I would keep looking."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 21 2008 ,Excellent service fantastic hotel and what a perfect location!,"I stayed with my fiance for 6 nights at Westin NY and it was very much the best hotel Ive ever stayed at. The service right from the beginning was just amazing. Everything worked so well, starting from the bell captains to the housekeepers. The professionalism throughout the staff was just something which is second to none and I cant give enough credit for their work.We got a really nice corner room from 32nd floor and the view was really nice indeed. Room had everything we could have ever asked for. The style is modern, but at the same time it hasnt got too carried away (for example the W hotels Ive visited things are a bit too weird for my taste compared to this, not that W hotels would be bad, I dont say that, but I prefer Westin style) - the functionality of the room was really at the highest level.During our stay the housekeeper made enormous effort every day to make the room look like new and she even regularly asked if there would have been anything else we would have liked her to arrange - more towels, anything. This pro-active attitude was really amazing to experience. But there was nothing we could have asked more - the work she did was just perfect.I have worked at the high style hotel some 10years ago and I would think I pretty much know what to expect - but this stay was just above all expectations. At the reception desk the concierge was always so helpful and same thing with the theatre &amp; tours reservation desk. We also used the Spa and gym during our stay, and I cant think any better service or facilities there either. We had the opportunity to use the Executive Club lounge at the 8th floor to get our morning breakfast there, which was also very nice way to start the day before exploring the city.I will recommend this hotel to all my colleagues and friends/relatives who aim to stay in New York in the future. I think the price and quality ratio at Westin NY is so much above any other hotel that its hard to find the correct words to describe the level of the facilities, service and satisfaction which you can get when staying at this fantastic hotel. I will choose Westin every time I visit in NY, there is absolutely no question about that."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 21 2008 ,Great Hotel for What we Paid,"I, my husband and our 13 year old daughter took our first NYC trip at the end of July. I read some really mixed reviews of this hotel but for $219 dollars a night I almost couldn't pass it up. We got the city view and it was incredible. We could watch the hustle and bustle below and sometimes hear the street bands play through our window. It was so conveniently located to times square and the comedy club across the street was AWESOME. The rooms are great, the beds are to die for. My own husband wouldn't even let me sleep with him because he wasn't sharing such a great bed with anyone LOL. Bathroom could have been cleaner, but who really cares. Maid services wasn't great, but again who cares. I guess the difference between the reviews you will read, and believe me I read ALOT,and my review is what I paid versus the rate you would normally pay. These rooms can go from 350 to 650 a room depending on the season. Service was great, location great, hotel was beautiful. Would I pay $600 a night? No way. But if your want a great hotel, and catch a great deal, I would definitely stay here again. Actually, I plan on going again in December of next year. If going visit Texas BarBQue. Good food, cheap drinks great atmosphere, but then again, I'm a native Texan. I hope you enjoy NYC as much as I did."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 20 2008 ,Excellent location!!,"We stayed at the Westin Times Square for a long weekend in celebration of my 30th birthday. We booked our room in February '08 through a Hotwire Travel Ticker promotion for $199/night. By the time our trip rolled around rooms in the hotel and the surrounding area were in the range of $350/night or more. Anyway, besides the price, I have absolutely no regrets about staying at the Westin. Location: Between 7th and 8th Avenues and 42nd and 43rd Streets. You are in the center of everything! Every subway line stops within a 1/2 block of the hotel. Times Square is within a block. You have the option of exiting/entering on 42nd or 43rd...If you're going on a walk to times square, etc. you can enter/exit on 42nd and be in the center of the action. If you need a cab with a lot less hassle, exit on 43rd and the bellman can get for you without dealing with all of the traffic/people of times square. There are drug stores within a block, restaurants line every street (the 24 hour McD's came in handy), two movie theaters (one in the hotel and one across the street on 42nd), Madame Tussaud's, and Ripley's are across the street. Friends we traveled with stayed near the UN and in Murray Hill. No matter where we were traveling for the day, we always had to start out in Times Square. So, it took us 2 minutes to get to the meeting place, they had to take cabs, buses, or very long walks.Hotel cleanliness, amenities: There is a Shula's Steakhouse and bar on the property...I didn't try either so I can't give a review on them. However, it was nice having the option. The room itself was extremely clean and exactly as pictured on the websites I researched before booking. We had a view of the Hudson River. The windows are tinted so you are not bothered by blazing sunrises/sunsets. We were on the 43rd floor and coincidentally there was an ice machine on our floor that was very convenient. The bedding and shower were fantastic! I've been in a number of hotels that offer their products for sale...this is one of the first I actually browsed through for pricing and purchase details. Amazingly, the prices weren't out of this world...I would definitely consider purchasing the double shower head and comforter/duvet, etc. We had occassion to speak with the concierge--we had to leave messages as to our requests and we received return phone calls or the information requested was printed and slipped under our door..AWESOME! The front desk clerk that handled both our check-in and check-out was friendly and recognized/thanked us for being Starwood members and asked if I had any questions/requests. Upon checking out we checked our baggage with the bell desk--we left our luggage with them for several hours while we went to explore Central Park and Midtown Comics before our flight home. Both drop off and pick up of our bags was smooth as silk and not to mention convenient. The only improvement I'd make to the hotel might be a pool but, who knows if we would even have time to enjoy it...not a deal breaker. Bottom line, I would definitely stay here again and look forward to doing so very soon."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 20 2008 ,fantastic location,"fantastic location at times square, superb size room with air conditioning. good view over the city."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 20 2008 ,Good value,"This hotel is good. Very good position at Times Square. Rooms ok, a bit drab, but beds/bathrooms are good...it's just the decor, weird colours. The bar/breakfast diner are fantastic, and all in all good value, we obtained a far better rate via the hotels own website. A must is Ellens diner nearby and avoid breakfast buffet at Hard Rock...!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 15 2008 ,A gem in the heart of Times Square,Being a New Yorker I have had the chance to stay at the good and the bad in the City. The old adage you get what you pay for is true here.We stayed at a club level room for my brothers 50th birthday and found this hotel fantastic. Not only were the rooms super clean the service was above expectations. We had a few drinks in Bar10 although very low key the bar tender and wait staff were friendly and courteous. The rooms in this hotel are much bigger than others like the W in the area. You don’t feel like you are in a closet. As far as convenience you are steps away from everything the area has to offer. Literally. We saw Young Frankenstein which was several doors away. Overall this hotel is in a class of itself. We are not high rollers but felt like kings for the weekend. and can’t wait to go back next year.
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 12 2008 ,Lovely Hotel,"Overall, this was a lovely hotel which I would definitely recommend if you are staying in New York.Our stay at the hotel started off quite badly as after 15 hours of traveling from England we arrived to find that our room wasn't ready as it hadn't been cleaned. The man on the desk told us he would go and find someone to clean it and would return in ten minutes. After ten minutes he informed us the room would be an hour till it was ready, at which point we were starting to get quite annoyed. However, they allowed us to have a complimentary meal at the restaurant and later in the week sent some wine and cheese up to our room as an apology for the inconvenience.Aside from this incident, the rest of the stay at the hotel was fantastic. We were lucky enough to get a room on the very top floor, the 45th, which had fantastic views of the city including the Empire State Building. The room was clean and spacious, and the hotel in general was very nicely presented.The staff were excellent, and if you do stay there I highly recommend going to speak to the concierge who were extremely helpful on a number of occasions at recommending places to go and things to do, and giving us their own local knowledge of the area.The location of the hotel was fantastic, just a short walk from Times Square.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to New York."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 10 2008 ,Not as happy this time around,"This is the second stay for our family at this Westin in the past year. We were so happy with it last year that we opted to stay here again this year. We were here for three nights and had a few problems that will make me look elsewhere for our NYC vacation next year. I am fiercly loyal to a hotel as long as I feel they are loyal and responsive to their customers. We are Starwood gold memebrs and we received NOTHING-not even a smile- for this level. The front desk staff was surly and did not look you in the eye. One day, we left our room at 8 am and returned at 3:30 to find it had not been cleaned. After at least three calls to housekeeping we talked to the manager Nick who either has not been trained properly or who does not care. He told us he would make sure it was cleaned immediately. Well it was not until at least 4:30 that the maids showed up. And we never got a call from management checking to make sure the room had been cleaned nor did we receive an apology or a nice touch such as a free drink. We stayed on the 33rd floor and in this room we heard everything going on in the room beside us. Our room had an adjoining door so that may have been the reason. We did not eat at the hotel so I can not comment on that. This hotel is in a great location for walking and there is a lot to do in the area. Would I stay here again- probably not. Not because of the amenities but due solely to the attitude of the staff. There are too many hotels in NYC that welcome business and that want to please customers."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 10 2008 ,I had a so-so stay at the Westin Times Square,"I took my girlfriend to the Westin Times Square for her 25th birthday. We had never been to NY before. Everything was great with the check in, our room. The robes seemed to be wore, and there was only 1 in the room. Housekeeping was quick to respond to bring us a second robe. The only complaint that I had, was at Bar 10. The food we ordered was not good. The food was under cooked and too salty. But we ate it and the next day my girlfriend &amp; I had food poisioning. It ruined our NY vacation.The hotel was nice enough to adjust the check off our bill.I would recommend the hotel, but definitely not Bar 10."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 9 2008 ,Great Service and Property,"We arrive late and unfortunately the hotel did not have our requested two bedded room available but the desk clerk volunteered to get the front desk manager who appologized, compensated us with a free dinner in the hotel restaurant and by the time we were through eating our request room was ready.The room was very large with two queen beds and plenty of room to move around plus large desk space, large closet, large bathroom with tub shower.The place was immaculately maintained and service always very professional and friendly...the even loaned me an umbrella one day and went out of their way with typical tourist questions.An excellent location just a block from Times Square, buses, subway, tour buses and all the conveniences and trappings of this great big beautiful ciy.Definately recommend."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 9 2008 ,Never again!,"We booked through Continental Guest Services from August 3-8, a continental club floor corner room. We booked a package which included several tours and 3 Broadway shows. We had to pre-pay for this package.We arrived early around 10 AM. We were told to check back around 1 PM in the event our room would be available. We went back around 1:30 PM and were told that a platinum starwood guest still occupied our room and the guest had the privilege to check our at 4 PM. I asked if we could have another room and I was told that it wouldn't be a club floor room but we'd have club floor privileges and a $100 credit. I agreed since my husband and I were dying to shower, and I was assured that the next day, Monday they'd take care of moving our luggage from our current room to the room we'd reserved and paid for in advance as long as I'd packed everything.We got back from our shopping tour Monday after 8 PM. I went to the front desk to get our keys for our new room. Guess what, the room hadn't been cleaned, and our stuff hadn't been moved. Can you imagine, unpacking, packing, and unpacking again in a span of 1 night? Not a good way to start a vacation.My husband was upset because he already felt cheated. There was no manager to face us or anybody in authority to offer us compensation for their shortcomings. I was told to return the next day. I went back Tuesday morning and was offered an additional $300 credit for our troubles.On hindsight, had it not been for the Broadway shows (Little Mermaid, Legally Blonde and Wicked) we really shouldn't have booked a package, because had we not prepaid, we'd have left the Westin the very next day. The hotel is conveniently located for watching shows, but the service, coordination, and hospitality is very poor. It just didn't make sense to me that a room would be left uncleaned, and that there was no housekeeping staff on duty at night.The experience at Westin Times Square has totally turned us off from booking with any other Starwood properties in the future!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 7 2008 ,Sleek ,"We stayed at the Westin from 28th June - 4th July 2008 and enjoyed every moment and will definitely book in next time we visit NY. I have stayed at the Westin in San Francisco so I knew that it was a very good quality hotel with high standards and style - exactly what we were looking for, for our trip of a lifetime to Manhattan. After letting them know that we were staying for a special occasion (my birthday) they put us on the 38th floor (room 3802) which was a corner deluxe king (we'd already upgraded to that though). The room was large (especially by NY standards), elegant and very sleek &amp; modern. The heavenly bed lived up to its name and we loved the double headed shower (next time we stay at a Westin we're going to buy one for our bathroom at home)There were a few things missing from our room (only one dressing gown for a double room for example) but they were quickly remedied by a phone call.We ate at Shula's which we really enjoyed (I'm a big steak fan). We were originally going to give it a miss as I’d read a number of unfavourable reviews here but we only had an hour before we were supposed to be downtown so we went there and I’m so glad we did. Dinner was delicious and the service was top notch.The deli diagonally across the road is highly recommended.The views were fabulous and as we had a corner room we had lots of windows so the room was light and airy. They have express lifts to the highest floors (23+) which was helpful. I visited the spa for a manicure which was fine (although my manicurist wasn't that friendly at first but I persevered and by the end of my appointment she was chatting with me). We ordered room service which was nice - a little expensive and the choice wasn't massive (it would have been nice if we'd been able to order from Shula's too). A very very minor quibble is that the room service cart was left outside in the hall for a day and a half even though we did tell them about it.The hotel has a great location just off Times Sq, friendly staff, clean rooms, coffee and all the usual mod cons. We had a wonderful time and the Westin added to the whole experience."
Westin New York at Times Square,Aug 3 2008 ,Fantastic Birthday Surprise,"My husband booked our first stay in New York as a 50th birthday surprise and the hotel delivered in almost every way. Just a couple of negatives. The receptionist said she would upgrade us but we only got what we had paid for!!! The room was excellent, the bed - well just 'heavenly' and the views from the 29th floor just amazing! My only other gripe is the huge charge for the internet and the fact that the business centre delivered a fax to our room 4 days after they received it!!! We never ate in the restaurant or drank in the bar due to the prices but there are plenty of places to eat and drink nearby so it really wasn't a problem. Perfect location too. If the hotel offer any good deals we will certainly be back here next time we visit New York!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 30 2008 ,Great beds great location great views but lacking that special something!,"Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Westin and on the whole it is a well equipped hotel in a great, central location, but it does lack that special something.My husband booked a deluxe corner room as a surprise for my 40th birthday and a couple of days before we went he emailed the hotel telling them of my 'special' birthday hoping that they might provide a birthday cake or something similar. Unfortunately, he didn't even receive a reply from them, yet alone a cake!PROS: Great location in the heart of Times Square; beds are the most comfortable that we have ever slept in; the views are stunning; the HD TV is fab.CONS: Cardboard Starbucks cups instead of china cups; only 1 white bath robe in a double room; very expensive restaurant; indifferent Reception staff.A good hotel in a good location, but don't bother if you want to celebrate a special occasion!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 29 2008 ,Pretty alright,"Stayed here in May for a few nights, after a business trip spent in the Sofitel. The Westin is quite touristy, but I thought it was pretty good for the money- only $320 per night for a deluxe room. A bargain for New York. Check in took a while- big queue in the lobby, but staff were friendly. Had a room on the 40th floor with a very decent view. Would recommend that people try to book a room on a high floor- even on the 40th, you could hear a little noise from the street, which was fine, but I suspect rooms on lower floors might be a bit noisy. The bedrooms feel a bit clinical- no warm wood tones here. Lots of white and grey surfaces, mixed with very dark wood. Sort of slate and stainless steel in the bathroom. Really comfortable mattress. Nice flatscreen tv. Room size wasn't massive, but definitely fine for one person. The rooms on higher floors are labelled as &quot;newly renovated.&quot; However, because it is such a busy hotel, I suspect these new rooms won't look new for very long. Some very minor signs of wear and tear. Also suspect the non-renovated rooms might not be very nice. Soundproofing in the room was alright. Not as good as the Sofitel, but miles better than the Grand Hyatt's paper-thin walls. There's a gym here, kind of small. Went to have a look around- a few machines, a bench, some free weights and mats. The hotel guide said there was a $10 charge- but I'm not sure if they actually make people pay. Instead I walked up a few blocks to W 55th Street and bought a day pass to somewhere called Club H- fantastic gym. Really clean, well equipped, loads of free weights and machines, plus a smoothie bar. Much better option if you want a decent workout- $25 but worth it if you are into the gym.Location is cheesy, but handy. Would definitely recommend the Westin for anyone going to New York for a holiday."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 26 2008 ,Loved the Westin NYC,"Stayed for 4 nights at the Westin NYC and it was a great stay. Excellent location, helpful staff and extremely comfortable &amp; clean bed (important after a long day of sightseeing)! Breakfast in hotel is a tad pricey but there is 'Europa Cafe', a cheaper place that you can go to right down the street."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 26 2008 ,The Westin: Pricey safe pricey clean pricey... busy.,"This was my 3rd time at the Westin on Time Square, of which the first 2 times were 'business' and while I appreciated the comfortable bed, I didn't really &quot;explore&quot; the Westin until I recently stayed there for a private occasion.Let's remember: It is after all NY. A lot of things in New York are overpriced. But first of all: the room. Certainly very comfortable beds, but after having spent at other places between my first two stays and this one, I have to say I was not as impressed as I had been a few years back. The Westin obviously upgraded to plasma flats screen TV's since then, so that's nice. I remember the furniture to be a little nice (I didn't have an extra ottoman in this room, but a rather ugly and not very comfortable chair w/ a stool). The bathroom was nice, even though it would be nice if the glas sliding door allows to be locked from the inside.The food in the hotel is outragiously overpriced. At least in my opinion. I spent one night at the hotel bar and consumed a ginger ale and a martini for together $22 dollars. From former experience I decided not to visit the steak house in the bottom floor of the hotel, which back then I did for breakfast and also found the pricing not relevant to the quality / amount of food served.Instead I frequent the European Cafe next door which in my opinion makes excellent salads, flat breads, breakfast foods, etc. One morning we even had them deliver, which they'll w/out extra charge, just that you have to pick it up from the front desk/security, because the Westin doesn't allow room deliveries from the outside.The Westin is conveniently connected to restaurants (a &quot;Shevy's&quot; Mexican restaurant which by the way has refreshing top shelf margaritas and food to go that is nicely packed and portioned generously, just in case you rather eat in your room), a Starbucks in the bottom floor, a movie theater, etc. Given the fact that it was a VERY hot summer weekend, the a/c cooled inside connection walk ways were quite refreshing. Location? Well, what's there to say? The Westin on Time Square says just that: the buzzing Time Square in front of it. If you are looking for the typical tourist New York experience, then its location is perfect. We could see Madam Tousseau's and Ripley's Believe it Or Not from our window, along w/ the typical view you would have from a top floor high rise in the city.Would I go back there? I am not sure. I now believe that there are comparable and/or even better hotels in that area. Plus, I don't know if I would choose such a tourist-driven area again for a visit. I think I would rather go to a little more 'authentic' in a more quiet neighborhood, possibly a B&amp;B.... The Westin - certainly not a bad choice, and if you want to be on the safe side, check in a hotel that appears to be safe, clean, central, etc. Be prepared to avoid the hotel options in regards to food unless you don't mind paying $30 for a chicken sandwich. But there are options to eat out everywhere around the Westin, not a problem!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 24 2008 ,Very pleasant stay,"My girlfriend and I had a 3 night stay at the Westin in New York city and have zero complaints!! If i had to be really picky, i could say they were a little slow at bringing us the terry cloth robes. We came home from a meal at the steakhouse(shula's, very good!) downstairs with some leftovers, but no place to keep them. The front desk sent up a fridge at 12:30am no problem. The staff was quite pleasant and very helpful. I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 24 2008 ,Good Experience,"I am a very frequent business traveller to Manhattan, but this was the first time I had stayed here. I was pleasantly surprised - the toom was fairly large, clean and the bathroom in excellent condition. Everything in the room worked. The bed was very comfortable and there was little or no noise (my room was on the 42nd floor). All in all, a minor miracle, considering where you are - one block from Times Square. And if you don't like the in-house food, there are millions of options within a mile radius.Service - I liked the &quot;one touch service&quot; - you call one number to get access to all services, rather than having to call room service, housekeeping, etc. separately. Some service gripes made me reduce my rating: my in-room dining cart and cutlery was not removed from room for an entire 24-hour period, although multiple housekeeping staff would have seen it. Secondly, as a business traveller I travel with two laptops, but I had to pay twice for Internet access, once for each computer. Central &quot;service express&quot; just told me to put my cart in the hallway and in relation to the Internet issue, said that that was &quot;just the way it was&quot;. Really superior customer service would have apologized for rhe first issue and waived the extra Internet fee."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 22 2008 ,Just perfect!,"After getting a fantastic rate for this hotel I was thrilled to see I got more than what I paid for. It was my son's birthday and first trip to NY and the Westin was fantastic.... They gave us a lovely room overlooking Times Square, sent a delicious cake, bottles of water and a cheese and fruit tray along with a Happy Birthday card to our room on the first night - very thoughtful and much appreciated by my son.The hotel itself is actually closer to 8th Ave (not as nice as 7th) but within a block of Times Square so no problem really. Our room was ready for check in at 3Pm and we were granted a late check out of 1PM the day we left. As always with Westin, the beds and showers were &quot;heavenly&quot; and that much is true! The room was made up very late one day but when I called to let them know it hadn't been done they came right up.All in all it was a fantastic stay and I will certainly be back again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 21 2008 ,Excellent in Every Aspect,"I recently booked a weekend stay at the Westin Times Square for my wife's 30th birthday. Everything about our stay was excellent beyond all expectations. The hotel is clean, quiet, comfortable, and very spacious. Given that I booked the trip through an online hotel/airfare package site, I was a little worried that our discounted room rate would result in discounted accommodations and service. Not so! The entire staff was professional, courteous and extremely helpful. More important, our room was outstanding. It was clean, spacious and comfortable just like the rest of the hotel. The central location is great for all that midtown has to offer, with Broadway theaters, Times Square and Hell's Kitchen (excellent restaurants) all within a few blocks and convenient subway access for those areas of the city a little further away. One final accolade... When confirming our reservation I asked about having a bottle of champagne waiting in the room upon our arrival. I decided not to follow through on the purchase as I wasn't exactly sure of our schedule, but the service agent I spoke to obviously made note of my request. Shortly after checking in, a chilled bottle of champagne arrived at our room, compliments of the hotel. Now that's service! Overall, I would rank the Westin as one of the top hotels in Manhattan. It's the only place we'll stay for any future trips."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 20 2008 ,Good Stay at the Westin,"We stayed for three days at the Westin Times Square from July 11th - 14th. We got an excellent rate through Expedia. Check-Inwas quick and friendly. We were upgraded to a club level roomon the 10th floor. Except for the tile on the bathroom floor needing a little buffing the room was clean and quiet. You did not hear the traffic except for a rare siren.We were one long block from Times Square and had a choiceof several medium-price chain eateries as well as a couple of McDoanld's and Subway's nearby.There were two subway stations within a block that made getting around a snap.One tip for those visiting needing soda and snacks. There is a Duane Ready Drug Store at the corner of Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street open 24 hours where you can stock up, Not as cheap as a big chain grocery store but much cheaper than the mini-bar.The one negative impression I had (and the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars) is that upon checkout the bellmen almost grabthe bags out of your hand and tackle each other to get that tip.I had one hustle a tip out of me for helping get two bags through the front revolving door."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 17 2008 ,Pros and Cons But Very Touristy!,"I stayed at the Westin on a recent business trip. The location would be a plus for trips focused on the theaters, and may well be excellent for families sightseeing in New York, but I found the location a big drawback. The area around the hotel is packed with tourists, chain restaurants, and garish signs - a very different atmosphere than comparable mid-town hotels outside the Times Square area. I can see that having affordable restaurants that appeal to kids and teenagers would be a big plus for family trips, but the atmosphere in the surrounding area was not the New York I knew from many prior trips.  On the other hand, standard rooms here are a bit larger than at many other New York hotels, with much better views. The prevalence of rooms with good views is the hotel's biggest draw. The bathrooms are depressing, though - clearly meant to be someone's idea of &quot;modern,&quot; but instead just look like what you'd expect to find in a public train station. In what seems to be an trend these days, the door to the bathroom is glass (at least this one is rather opaque), making it almost impossible for someone to use the bathroom at night or before sunrise without the light waking a companion.  If this hotel were in a different location, I would definitely be back - the hotel is very nice (except for those regrettable bathrooms), with views that are both good and rare for New York. For families heading to New York to sightsee, though, this would be a great choice."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 17 2008 ,Is this really a Westin?,"We arrived tired and a little edgy after flying in from Hong Kong, via LA. I was confident we would be looked after; my Starwood Gold card would look after us, right? Wrong! We were given what is without doubt the worst hotel room I have ever stayed in, in a developed country. The room was on the 9th floor, which, as it turned out, is also a convention and meetings area, where the few rooms are clustered together at one end. The room smelled musty, the plumbing was extremely noisy, and the fit out of the room reminded me of the 1970s. The piece de resistance, though, was the view...of a plant room some 10 feet from the window! The promised city view had not materialised, though if I stood on the bed and looked up I could just see the sky. We asked for another room, but were told there wasn't one. In the morning, we were woken by the rattle of trolleys, provisioning the conference and meetings area for the day. In short, a disaster, and one which caused me to wonder what standards are applied by Starwood to ensure its properties under the Westin brand are uniformly good. I have stayed at first class Westins in Shanghai, Auckland, Melbourne, and Sydney; they bear no resemblance, other than the name, to this place. Thankfully there was a first rate steakhouse on site, and the door staff were most helpful...without that I would have demanded my money back...and I wasn't paying!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 15 2008 ,Westin was Great!,"After taking a redeye flight from Denver to NYC and arriving at the hotel at 7:30am, I was PRAYING that they would give us a room. Unfortunately, they did not right away. We were put on a &quot;pre-checking in list&quot; and the bell hops held our luggage. We decided to walk around Times Square and eat breakfast to kill some time. The font desk man noted that they will give us a call when a room becomes available. Fabulous!We booked 4 nights through Westins website using a code we received off of Travelzoo. Two nights were in a upgraded room (since the price we higher) and the next two nights were in a regular room (lower price), but the front desk man said we could just stay in the same room the whole time.Well 10am came around and we still haven’t heard anything from the hotel. We went into the lobby and sat down just to rest. I have to admit that the Westin has the best smelling lobby in the world! No joke. We went up to the front desk again to see if there was any updates and they did have a room for us! Up to 3606 on the 36th floor!The view was out the westside of the building. The room was very clean and modern, but a little plain. Beds were comfy, tv was great and the shower heads, to die for! Only complaint was that there was not enough room on the vanity. The location could not have been better. We were just around the corner from Duane Reeds (like Walgreens) a movie theatre was in the same building and so was Chevy's Mexican Grill. The blue subway entrances were right across 8th. Time Square was a 2 minute walk (I would suggest taking 42nd as there are more sights to see- on 43rd you have to walk by a strip club and a shady hotel) Sadly, our 5th night at the Westin had to be moved to Marriott Marquis a couple of blocks over. The Wednesday night rate at the Westin was way out of our budget.I highly recommend the Westin Times Square and I wish I was back in New York!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 14 2008 ,Great rooms great locations lot of in an outs,"The price was excellent value for money, the location can not be improved but the lobby felt like the hall of a train station, lots of going in and out. Lacks some warmth. Nevertheless to be recommended"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 14 2008 ,Disappointed for our 20th Wedding Aniversary!,"Very dissappointed! We made arrangements over three months ago to celebrate in the city where we went as Honeymooners 20 years ago-I had requested an upgrade to the room if at all possible-with three months you think that I could have a better room than one that faces the side street. This was 4 nights over the July 4th weekend and it would have been lovely to at least have a room that looked out over the East river to watch the fireworks! As starwood preferred members if that was the best they could do than you might prefer to be non-preferred as you might be treated with more respect and courtesy. Some of our bath towels were frayed and had seen better days and the Hevenly Bed must have gone the other direction (to Hell) and never returned as the mattress had seen better days. The Westin In Vancouver, Canada had the best mattress and that is what led us to book at the Westin in NYC. The front desk lady was not friendly at all but the bell captain and staff were very nice and helpful. There are other hotels for the kind of money spent here that will treat you as a treasured guest and I will see them again in the future."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 13 2008 ,Great hotel for first trip to NYC,"This was my families first trip to NYC. We booked the hotel based on its location and reviews. We had a junior suite on the 28th floor. The room was large enough for my family of 4. The room was clean, quiet and the king bed was as good as it gets. The location was close to broadway theaters, time sq.,and the subway. The concierge booked all of our tours, shows etc. all great recomendations. The complementary breakfast was in a nice area with a friendly staff. Overall my stay was much better than what other reviewers have reported. Will definately stay at this hotel on my next trip back."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 12 2008 ,Use the safe.,"The hotel was everything I expected, but I want to advise everyone to use the safe provided in the room. I left a necklace and earrings on the desk when we left for the day. The cleaning service came in to clean our room, and when I went to wear the items the next day they were missing. I filled a report with the hotel, and they questioned the cleaning staff. But nothing was seen by anyone. I don't like accusing anyone of stealing, but I thoroughly checked all of my luggage. Please don't experience what I experienced, use the safe for any of your treasured or high dollar items."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 9 2008 ,July 4 2008,"My Boyfriend and I stayed at the Westin Times Sqaure for 5 nights for my birthday which was the 4th of July. I honestly do not know how anyone can say anything bad about this hotel. Check in was super fast and we even received an upgrade to a corner room eventhough the hotel was 100% full. The room and view was incredible. The room was always clean and housekeeping did a great job. The heavenly bed is really heavenly!!! I have never slept in a better bed than this one, after a long day of walking New York City it was nice coming back to such comfort. The staff is very polite and always willing to help. They even sent up a bottle of wine for my birthday... I do not understand how anyone can say anything negative about this hotel... It was a great experience.. Would stay there again..."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 9 2008 ,Great hotel - Mediocre staff,"We booked direct with the hotel and got an executive room which was spacious, with a great bathroom though the view was poor. The breakfast in the executive lounge was good, with friendly staff (sometimes) just enough for a days sightseeing. The Shula's restaurant was fantastic and the meal well worth the cost, staff were very attentive too.Be very careful with your belongings - I left my bag in the hotel bar in the early hours of the morning (when there were only a few residents left), it was tucked away in a corner not in view. The bag wasn't handed in, even though the bar closed shortly after we left and i noticed it was missing before they re-opened. The bar had been cleaned but the bag wasn't handed in. When I reported it to reception they were not particularly interested and didn't even tell me to contact security. My husband went back later as he was less than happy about losing the cash, credit cards and my camera with all our pictures on from sightseeing in New York and Nashville for four days. Reception were more helpful this time and contacted security and the Bar Manager. We were told the Manager would contact us when he arrived in and had spoken to the cleaner, he never did and we had to keep on going back to ask security, going back over the details every time which when your trying to visit a city in three days is a waste of time. Losing the debit and credit cards almost ruined our trip as we were unable to do everything we planned as we only had the cash that my husband was carrying, fortunately we'd pre-paid for the hotel room and our passports weren't in there or we would have been stuck!Great centrally located hotel with the sort of staff often found in large cities."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 6 2008 ,Excellent Stay,"We stayed at the Westin Times Square on a recent Friday and Saturday night (06/20-22) with a good priceline bid of $170. The hotel is very nice and in an excellent location.The day of our check-in, I called the Westin to see if we could check-in early at about noon. To my surprise, the person on the phone said he couldn't answer me, I would just have to go to the hotel and see if they have any rooms available when we arrive. I thought that was odd, but we went to the hotel anyways. We were given a king room (#1403) on the 14th floor upon checking in without any wait. The room was very clean and modern looking. Some of the highlights of the room were:Large, LCD TV,Dual shower heads,Very comfortable bed,Decent sized room.Unlike other hotels in NYC where you might have a view of a brick wall, we had a decent view looking west to the Hudson River out of large widows. The only problem we encountered during our stay was a slow drain in the shower. It was slow enough to be a little annoying but not bad enough that we requested service - I simply informed them of the problem upon check-out.Besides the quality of the hotel, the best perk was the location. The hotel is basically on top of the A/C/E 42 Street - Port Authority subway station, across the street from the bus terminal, and just a block away from Time Square and the the 1/2/3/7 lines.Overall, we had an excellent stay there and would not hesitate to go again, especially at that price."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jul 4 2008 ,OK stay in Times Square,"The Westin NY Times Square was pretty nice, but nothing to write home about. We got our rooms on a special rate under $200 per night, which is great for this area. At that rate, the hotel was well worth it, but I would never pay the normal $300-$400. On this trip we also stayed at the Westin Grand in DC and the Westin in Philadelphia. This hotel in Times Square was definitely inferior to the other two. The staff here were not very friendly. The tub in the bathroom was stopped up and the cordless phone next to the bed did not work. Housekeeping didn't clean our room the first day, either. The hotel's location is great for shows and Times Square attractions, and the Heavenly Beds are always extremely comfortable."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 30 2008 ,Great Location,"Checked into the Westin on a Friday afternoon without too much hassle or delays, asked for ajoining rooms, got ones that were beside eachother, but no connecting door. Rooms were nice, clean, modern with an absoluely fabulous view of the river. That was an unexpected bonus. They were kind of small, but bigger than I expected after reading about NY hotels. The staff were friendly and helpful, expecially Nina at the concierge desk. The only hiccup we saw was that we booked 2 nights at 2 seperate rates........and were automatically checked out after our first night.........so keys didn't work, credit cards were charged etc. The clean up was horrific although the staff at the front desk did their best to be accomodating and helpful. Nice hotel with good service!"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 29 2008 ,Disappointing,"We have stayed in several Westin hotels around the world especially in Asia and have always had excellent experiences with the hotel's service, room, facility and so on. We natually expect Westin on Time Square to meet the same 5-star standard. However, we were very disappointed. The lobby looked run down, decoration in the room was just plain, the bathroom was very basic (kind of like Super 8 hotel) and the housekeeping service was very slow. We had to call twice to get extra shampoo. In a nutshell, we will not recommend this hotel to any one. There are other better hotels in the same area. We paid a 5-star rate but did not get the same level of value."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 26 2008 ,Excellent!,"We stayed at the Westin from 21-24 June. I had booked a king deluxe city view. This was our first trip to NYC, and we were also celebrating our 10th anniversary. I mentioned that in the comments when I booked the room and when we arrived we'd been upgraded to a king deluxe corner view on the 43rd floor. It was very nice. The hotel is a block from Times Square. We could see into Times Square, but didn't have a great view of it. Our view of the rest of the city and the water was very nice. The location was close to everything we wanted to access. I had no complaints about the service. Our room was always made up when we'd returned by midday. One day they forgot to replace the coffee and another day they didn't replace the water. The heavenly bed was truly heavenly, to the detriment of our plans, as I had difficulty getting my wife up from her nap to get to our Broadway play. We may end up purchasing one at some point. The heavenly shower was nice.Altogether, a very nice experience. I found the staff to be courteous and helpful each time I dealt with them and would definitely recommend the Westin."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 24 2008 ,Honeymoon in New York,Excellent hotel in the heart of New YorkVery nice modern size.Try to book a corner room in the highest possible floor.The view is amazing.
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 23 2008 ,Nice Hotel,We stayed at the Westin for our recent NY trip and loved the location! The room were nice and clean. The beds were great. Bathrooms were nice but with little counter space. The rooom service was great and fast. I would stay again.
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 22 2008,The hotel was ok.,"This hotel was not the best hotel I stayed in before.When you ordered something through the concierge it takes them like 30 minutes to bring something.For example we asked for an extra bed earlier as we came to this hotel. When we got to our room and it wasn't there so we called the concierge to bring it up.Well of course he said &quot;ok, we will bring it right now&quot; We had to wait for approximately 30 minutes for them to bring up the extra bed.The extra bed was not the only thing that came late. Our suitcases didn't come for about 20 minuted. To every hotel I ever went to, they usuallybrought up our luggages in about 5 to 10 minutes.Another trouble we had at this hotel was was the breakfast room service. The food was pretty good, and we finshed it and left in in our room. We absolutely thought they would clean it up before we came back at 2 o'clock, but when we did it was still there.We called the concierge to take away our room service that we had in the morning. Of course the concierge said, &quot;Ok, we will do it right now&quot; WE left our room and went to watch amusical ad eat dinner and came back at 9 o`clock. Guess what? THE ROOM SERVICE WAS STILL THERE.One last incident that ade me furious was when we asked for a sewing kit and called the concierge they said the exact same thing. WE waited for 30 minutes AGAIN and please try guess what they brought? A VANITY KIT. WE paid them a dollar tip for somethign we didn't ask for. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLEFor a hotel that cost 400 dollars a night I think this was an absolute waste of money. The rooms were small, no locks on the bathroom, and the guest service is HORRIBLE. They say they will do things RIGHT AWAY and they do not.I know Times Square is a really busy place and many people stay at the WEstin Times Square Hotel but I would be glad if they actually did what they SAY.I wuoldn't come back to this hotel again."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 22 2008 ,Cheap Fantastic Corner Room Booked On Hotel Website,"Booked via hotel website and averaged US$260 a night over 4 nights (inclusive) as they had a 3 night for price of 2 special for Thur to Sat check-ins and a US$199 a night special for Sundays.The very spacious corner room had 4 big windows with a view of the Hudson River through one window.Service was generally excellent but they stuffed up a little bit on check in - firstly, had to go way for 30 minutes as our room &quot;was not ready&quot; until check-in time of 3:00pm - this is bollocks as I am sure there was a room ready for us.; secondly, they lost track of our luggage and we were kept waiting around in our room for 50 minutes.Location was great as in Time Square area but the subway station under Times Square is quite large and required a lot of walking from 46th to 42nd Street.One of the classiest standard hotel rooms I have ever stayed in ever and we were very lucky with the price,"
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 21 2008 ,Loved the Westin in NY!,"Loved this hotel. Very central location to Times Square in NY! Great views, great hotel, great service, beautiful room. It has a great ramp from the hotel to a shopping/dining area on the other side of the street. I would definetely stay here again and again!We stayed from March 9th - March 11th, 2008. The only thing I would recommend is stay on the Times Square Path area and not stray on the streets that run along it because there are bad elements around there."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 19 2008 ,Best Hotel I Ever Stayed At!!!!!!!,I stayed at the Westin on June 17th and it was the best hotel I have ever stayed at. It was deff the BIGGEST room I was ever in in NYC. I shared a room with my friend who had booked it for a very low $147.00. I was looking at the real room price and it turns out that we were in a $1500.00 a night room. The double shower head was AMAZING and I wanted to take it home with me. The beds were comfy but not as comfy as I expected them to be. The quilt(comforter) that was on it was so heavy that it gave me leg cramps while I was trying to sleep. The BIG flat screen TV was a plus as was the Ipod dock radio. Overall I would stay there again only if I could get a great deal like my friend did because quite frankly I could never afford to stay there any other way.
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 18 2008 ,Not up to Westin Standards,"I have stayed at Westin Hotels all over the world because I love them...all but the Westin Times Square. The lobby was dingy and the furniture was worn. Our room was large by NYC standards but there was a dirt spot on one of the duvets and dust on the headboards. They did accommodate an early check-in and late departure. However, after requesting a 2:30 check-out time we found ourselves locked out of our room after returning at 2:15. Apparently the keys automatically time out at 2pm but no one bothered to tell us. The hallway had debris in it for an entire day that was not cleaned up, etc. The beds were comfy as always, but other than that I would not recommend this hotel."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 17 2008,Great Location ~ OK Room ~ Great Service,"Hi......Booked for a weekend trip to the city. Stayed Friday - Sunday. Our flight was delayed and we arrived at 10:00 pm - the receptionist gave us drink vouchers for the bar since the club level was closed. Very nice. We booked through the website - great deal and then after we booked we received an email from the hotel w/ an offer for $50 upgraded to club level. We accepted the offer and really enjoyed the club level. Drinks, breakfast and afternoon appetizers (which were more of a meal than a snack:).......room was just ok - we didn't find the bed nearly as comfy as previous westin stays and our view on the 26th floor wasn't good either - definitely request room w/a view......Our flight on Sunday did not leave until 9:00 pm so they happily kept our luggage safely while we went to the Yankees Game and enjoyed the city. After we returned we were able to shower in the spa and change before our flight home, which was a wonderful touch since it was such a hot weekend. Staff went above and beyond to meet our every need. We realllllllllly enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate for the location again - soooo close to Times Square, Broadway Shows, Subway, etc."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 17 2008 ,Good choice,"This is a very nice hotel. It is located in the Times Square area, and several Broadway theaters are within 1-3 blocks. There are plenty of restaurants in the area as well. The hotel itself is nicely decorated. I stayed in a corner city-view room, which offered impressive views of the city. The room was average in terms of size but above average in terms of decoration and comfort. The shower features 2 shower heads. It might not be good for the environment, but it sure felt good. The air conditioning was not able to keep up with the 100 degree weather as much as I would have liked, but the room was fairly comfortable. Overall, this is a very nice hotel in a good location. Pricewise, you'll pay for it, but this is still a good choice."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 16 2008 ,Less than impressed,"I’m aware that NY hotels are not all that great, but the Westin Times Square did not impress for the price. I’m not sure what everyone is raving about. The hotel is located in a VERY crowded area of Times Square surrounded by chain restaurants (McDonalds, Chevy’s, etc) and strip clubs. I counted 4 strip clubs to be exact. I recommend staying closer to Central Park. We also had numerous billing problems. Even though our room was on the Executive Club Level they kept charging us every time we used one of our club level perks that was supposed to be included. Also, our room keys did not work and the water coming out of the sink and shower had a sewer-brine smell to it. The hotel also had back to back high school prom’s the nights we were staying there and the hotel was allowing the loud music past 1:00am. Who knew there were high school proms on Sunday and Monday? Pass on this hotel. (FYI – I am a Starwood Preferred Member)."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 16 2008 ,2nd Stay Not As Nice As First,"I stayed here for five nights in June of 2008. I had stayed at this hotel two years prior to this visit and my second trip as not as nice as my first. The staff seemed bothered every time you would ask them a question. The room was nice and I was offered my choice of view... that was nice. However, the room looked a bit worn from my last trip. It was not dirty, but it just did not have a fresh feeling to the room. The location is great if you are looking to attend the theatre. The Javits was my destination and the walk is not bad. Its a long walk, but its an easy 15 min walk. They do not offer free access to the gym to SPG members. As a loyal member, this was quite a turn off. I dont think I would return for that very reason. I think the fee was only $10 a day, but again as a loyal member one should not have to pay to go to the gym when you are paying ~$400 a night. When you travel as much as I do, a gym is critical. I ran in central park every day, so that was a nice option; but, if you do not run be warned."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 16 2008 ,Weekend Stay in NYC,"We arrived on Friday afternoon and had put in a request for a club level room which was unavailable. We were told that we had been upgraded to a better room but I couldn't see anything out of the ordinary. The lobby was extremely crowded. We had a leak issue in the room and reported it to the front desk. Someone from Engineering called to confirm the situation and promptly took care of it while we were out to dinner.Our room was on a higher floor and provided a spectacular view of the river. There are two entrances to the hotel (one facing 42nd and one facing 43rd) which provides easy access to the subway system and Times Square.Overall, the location was great and the accomodations were comfortable. The hotel decor is very modern and clean. Our room had a stainless steel sink and counter area along with two shower heads in the shower. The beds were the signature Westin Heavenly Bed and the room had a beautiful flat screen television."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 15 2008 ,great stay in the city,"This hotel worked well for a pre-christmas trip to New York. The room was fine and the location was great (used to be a pretty rough area not long ago across from port authority bus terminal). The one time we needed help from the concierge we had to wait a tremendously long time and the hotel was at very low occupancy.The room itself was a standard Westin room, which is a good thing. I'd stay here again if the price was right (this is New York and that is always a consideration) but nothing stood out as a particularly fine experience worthy of another stay."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 10 2008 ,What a waste!,"We booked nine rooms for my sister's wedding party in NYC, of which four weren't ready for occupancy when we arrived at 4.00pm (including the bride's room). No apology was made; in fact staff seemed bemused that we might even find this unsatisfactory. When questioned, the concierge advised us that although she was from Brooklyn, she couldn't help with restaurant reservations there: she only knew about Manhattan (although seemingly didn't know what day the Museum of Modern Art might be closed). Towels weren't replaced after the first night, and we had to repeatedly ring for replacements; neither was bottled water, which given the amount we paid can hardly be described as a luxury; decor can only be described as dowdy; and, incredibly, room to room calls were charged to the bill!! This hotel is simply too large for the staff to care about service. Don't waste your money staying here."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 9 2008 ,Good for business or theater,"This is good hotel if you are in town on business, or want to be really close to the various theaters. Otherwise, it is a bit generic. Pros-If you are a platinum guest you have free use of the executive lounge (free breakfast etc) and the gym.-Decent sized rooms for New York.-Easy to grab a taxi on eight avenue.-Less congested than W in Times SquareCons-Area can be a bit sketchy.-Don't often get platinum upgrades.-If you're not a platinum guest, I think you have to pay for the gym.-Room service food not great."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 7 2008 ,Great Stay at the Westin,"I stayed at the Westin on May 30th and I was really pleased with everything. I stayed in a junior suite on the 35th floor and we loved the room! My boyfriend and I also asked for the romance package which was a really nice plus. I checked in at 3 and it was flawless, shortly after arriving to our room we were greeted with champagne and strawberries. Anything we needed, it was there promptly and this includes a refridgerator, new sheets and towels, and room service. Very fast service and we never had to wait for anything.It was also nice to come back from dinner and find more strawberries and champagne waiting for us(which we never asked for). Overall a really great stay and would stay here again. I would also recommend that couples go for the romance package - for an extra $50 you get a 4pm checkout, free breakfast in the Shulas restaurant(which was delicious), and complimentary strawberries and champagne. Definitely worth it."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 2 2008 ,Great Hotel - Great Location - Great Room,"My wife and i stayed in the Westin for 3 nights at the end of May.Arrived into Newark and took the bus into the Port Authority bus terminal, this was cheap and easy to do and very very close to the Westin, so was a breeze. We arrived early and the room was not ready, but we expected this and the staff immediately offered to take our bags until 3pm when the room would be ready, we came back about 3:30 and the room was available.What a room! Booked a corner room, we were placed on the 39th floor and had amazing views of the Empire State building along one side and up and down the Hudson on the other. Room was clean and fresh and all the fittings were in perfect working order. nice flat screen TV for when we were relaxing. The only tiny problem we had was our fridge locking itself on our last day, but a quick phonecall to reception had a man at our door in under 5 minutes who fixed this promptly. Check in/out was quick and easy, the business centre offers free use of the internet for checking in for flights, which was very very useful.When asking for advice from the hotel staff they were all friendly and helpful often finding us a map and often pointing out discounts that are available.We never used the hotel restaurant, as we ate out all the time and looking at the prices i am glad we did.The location is fantastic, very close to the action of Times Square and quite central for all the shopping and sight seeing.In conclusion i would highly recommend a corner room at the Westin, we have already promised ourselves we will stay there when we go back next year (hopefully)."
Westin New York at Times Square,Jun 1 2008,Fabulous Hotel ,"I just got back from an overnight stay at this hotel and I must say it was great!!This is my first time leaving a review. I felt this hotel was worth taking the time to do so.First, the staff is super friendly and accomodating. Check In is at 3 PM, however, we arrived at 10 AM and got our room right away!!After check out on our last day, they held our luggage at the hotel while we did some more sightseeing.The rooms were spacious. The beds were super comfy and the shower was awesome!!The location is in the heart of Times Square and a block from Port Authority. I would recommend without any hesitation."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 31 2008 ,Excellent location. Too crowded.,"Pros:- Yes, the location is excellent, near the theaters and everything else in times square.- The room is clean, spacious, bed is confortable, shower is great...- We asked for a late check-out and got one more hour cost-free.Cons:- The front desk staff is always busy. We took a long time to check-in/check-out. The hotel is big and too crowded, there are always too many people checking-in/out.- We've tried to buy theater tickets with the hotel's concierge service but it was too expensive. We bought it through ticketmaster.- We ate once at the hotel's reataurant but I would rate it as a three-star food and the staff was unsympathetic.- I've received a package through the business center and it was delivered to our room, what is positive. The problem is that I was told that this would be cost-free but we were charged (but it was so cheap we did not even complaint about it).Overall it is a very good hotel, especially if you want to stay near times square. I would rate it as a regular four-star."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 31 2008 ,Great Stay great location,We were so pleased with this hotel that we choose to stay here for extending a business trip rather than move to the W (which we had originally planned). Room was similar in style to the W but much larger. Nice views. True Westin quality in recently re-done rooms. All Westin amenities apply.The location in Times Square and proximity to the subway was great. We'll stay here again!
Westin New York at Times Square,May 28 2008 ,Absolutely Fabulous. Stay there!,"I took my girlfriend to New York for her birthday, it was the first time she has been there, she loved it but loved the hotel... we both did!I booked a Corner Deluxe Room but took the time to contact the hotel by email in advance to see if we could get a higher room with a view. They responded promptly &amp; offered us a upgrade to their Executive Club which allowed us free breakfast in their Executive dining room &amp; a room on the 42nd floor!!! I could see the Empire State Building from my bed!!!On top of that, they sent up a complimentary bottle of wine &amp; strawberrys to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. Lovely touch.The concierge also pulled a few strings &amp; got me a table at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant at the London Hotel. Very nice &amp; not as expensive as you would think.The location is brilliant, a block away from Times Square.I recommend the Steak House in the hotel, Shula's. Amazing steaks &amp; excellent service. To conclude.... Stay there, they will look after you."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 27 2008 ,Great location fabulous service.,Just spent a six night stay at this hotel. Booked through SPG as hubby is plat and got a great upgrade to a suite. Check in was smooth and quick. Bags were already in our room when we arrived. So close to Times Square and Broadway shows.Saw Spamalot and it was just around the corner. Also walked to Rockefeller Center and to Central park. The hotel also arranged cars for us and booked us on a fabulous helicopter tour through Manhatten Helicopters. Can't say enough about the fabulous service we had. Wasn't really fond of the stainlesss steel sinks in the bathroom but that was a very minor detail. Overall our family loved the Westin. We are already planning a return trip in September!!
Westin New York at Times Square,May 26 2008 ,Busy large scale hotel,"My husband and I were there on vacation over Memorial Day weekend. The hotel is clean, safe, and good size room for NYC. If you want to spend time in Time Square and like a busy/touristy location, this is a good match. Otherwise, stay in another part of town. You will get the Time Square experience here."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 23 2008 ,Loved it !,"This hotel is located in the heart of Times Square and everything is a stone throw away be it theatres, cinemas, and night life. Amazing location and fantastic spacious rooms. Highly recommend it."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 20 2008 ,Great Location,"This hotel has a great location, right in the heart of Times Square, and across the road from the Port Authority (buses and train service). It is surrounded by dozens of eating places and the usual touristy shops. Check in was smooth and fast, as I arrived in the evening. I was given access to the Executive Lounge, which was nice (continental breakfast of boiled eggs, fruit, cereal, toast and pastries) Cocktail time cheese and crackers, antipasto platter and usually two hot hors d'oeuvres - wine is available as well.The rooms are relatively small, with superb Westin comfort beds and LCD TV. The bathrooms are small as well, but adequate. Found the amenities to be rather frugal this time around - very limited and I had to call down and ask for a shower cap, cotton balls etc. Also had to ask to have the &quot;free&quot; coffee and tea replenished as this wasn't done. The room cleanliness was so/so - bits of paper and tissue left on the carpet, and in the bathroom until we complained about that. Seems like they don't vacuum every day!Overall, this is a good hotel and we would most definitely return -"
Westin New York at Times Square,May 20 2008 ,Great Time at Westin NYC!,"The Westin was great. 38th floor offered nice city and Hudson River view. Would definately stay there again. Close to times square, theatres and 42nd St Subway station. Nice hotel bar too."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 18 2008 ,A Wonderful Lovely Stay at the Westin,"Our rooms were booked using Priceline less than a week before our stay. Our 2 night Monday to Wednesday stay, May 12-14, at the Westin went well. There was no way I could pay rack rates of $500 a night so without Priceline our spur of the moment, side trip to New York from Washington D.C. would not have happened. My tired, aching feet were happy our Priceline bid landed us at the Westin-Times Square.When I called to confirm our reservation, at check in and when we checked out no mention was made of Priceline. All that was noted was that the room was prepaid. I was asked for a photo ID at check in and a credit card for incidentals. Westin staff were all cordial and helpful. I saw no children other than ours at the hotel during our stay. Every Westin staff person we ran into welcomed the kids. They were made to feel really special, complimented and treated like little princesses. I noted we were traveling with 3 young children and needed rooms next door to each other when I called to confirm. I was actually assigned adjoining rooms, exactly what we wanted. The standard Westin-Times Square (a bit confusing because Westin-New York is on hotel signs) room has 2 double beds so this worked great for us. I do remember looking out the window at some point and the view was nothing special. A view was not important as what little time we spent in the room we were asleep or getting dressed so the shades were drawn. A shame really because the room had wall to wall windows. There were both shades and black out curtains at the windows. The trademark Westin beds were as marketed, heavenly.Room size seemed normal with ample room between the beds and the walls. I liked the padded bench to sit on or to put suitcases on that was next to the dresser. We lived out of our suitcase so did not use the dresser drawers. If 4 people are in the room drawer space will be tight. The bathroom had a pocket door and an itty bitty sink but was as spacious as most hotel bathrooms with excellent water pressure. One white terry cloth robe and one bottle each of shampoo, conditioner, lotion, mouth wash with 2 small bars of soap stocked the bathroom. If I cared or was the nitpicking sort I guess I could complain that no shower cap was provided. The towels were large and 4 complete sets per room were provided. I saw one woman in the elevator carrying a cellophane wrapped toothbrush with a 1 inch tube of toothpaste so I assume extra hygiene products were available upon request. The room was clean and all rooms were non smoking. At one point during the evening I was sure I smelled cigarette smoke. I'm not sure how the nonsmoking rule is enforced. There was a large flat screen TV, a safe, iron, coffee maker, ice bucket, glasses and disposable cups, IPOD dock with radio and alarm clock in the room but no refrigerator with high priced snacks. If you can't find something look in the closet everything, even the coffee maker, was hidden behind the sliding door. We heard the occasional siren during the night but no other city noise. Once the door was closed I heard no hall noise or sounds from neighboring rooms. Walking down the hallway, I could hear the TVs from other rooms. I'm not one for decor but I think modern best describes the rooms. Not exactly my cup of tea but black, orangy gold and stainless steel were what stuck with me along with the all white heavenly beds. We arrived by train at Penn Station (about 5 minutes and $6.25 by taxi to the Westin) so I have no idea what parking was like or the cost. I found using busses or the subway to get around was not particularly easy, inexpensive or fast. If they could be found the Transit employees were not at all helpful in navigating the system so we relied on our feet. The Times Square crowds were not too bad during the day but at night the sidewalks were so crowded it was difficult to walk. On a positive note this made me feel quite safe walking with kids (holding hands in a chain) out late after taking in a couple of Broadway shows. We saw Phantom at the Majestic Theater less than a 2 minute walk from the Westin. Our Tuesday night show was at the Longacre on 49th between 8th and Broadway. Through the slooow evening crowds this was about a 15 minute walk.The Westin was a 5 to 7 minute stroll to the Marriott Marquis where the TKTS discount ticket booth is temporarily located. This was important because I had not booked any theater tickets and relied on TKTS for tickets for both nights. In fact we stopped and purchased tickets for our first night before checking into the Westin. The Westin's location made it easy to plan our sight seeing around the TKTS booths hours, allowing one adult to stand in line while the other took the kids back to the hotel to rest and for snacks. The TKTS line moved quickly. On Monday I got in line at 3:07 and had tickets at 3:48. On Tuesday we got in the play only line at 2:00 and had tickets to our show of choice in 15 minutes. I've been told this is common early in the week but one should arrive at the booth earlier later in the week and on weekends. On our last day at the Westin I asked for a late check out but it was not available. We checked out at noon and were able to leave our bags with the bellman and get in a full day of sight seeing. I was told as long as we were back to pick up our bags by midnight we would be fine. We of course got back well before midnight. The bellman got us a taxi with no waiting and we were off. The Westin was an excellent hotel at any price and a dream come true at Priceline rates."
Westin New York at Times Square,May 17 2008 ,Wonderfull week in NY,"We spent five days in NY , we stay at Westin Time square , perfect location for visiting all the city . Close to the theater , we experienced Spamelot , amusing easy also for who doesn't speek fluently . Excellent japan restaurant in front of the hotel absolutely not expensive (expecially with the exchange rate $ vs € at 1,55) I suggest to book with expedia also the city pass ( 6 tikets for museums, empire state building and circle line with a special discount)"
Westin New York at Times Square,May 14 2008 ,Brill Hotel - couldnt ask for better,"We stayed at this hotel for my hubby's 30th bfday (end of April 08) - had emailed the hotel earlier and on arrival was told there were no corner rooms left but we were given 2 rooms on the 29th floor (we travelled with friends as well) and were really happy with them - the lift is mad and takes u to ur floor really quickly.On entering the room (which was roomy, very clean and had the facilities people stated earlier, huge lcd telly, ipod docking station etc) we got a lovely card welcoming us to the hotel and a cake for my hubby's bfday which i thought was a nice touch.we had nice views over the river and could see the helicopters going up and down daily and views of other large buildings in the area, nice large windows.Would defo recommend this hotel - the location is great - nice deli on the corner - europa or something its called for a quick breakfast before heading off for the sitesReally close to Times Square and walking distance to main attractions - if i returned to New York would defo stay here again - the staff were helpful and the rooms were cleaned daily and always had fresh towels. The bed is to die for and want one back home here in the UK ha ha We tried the Hotel bar and thought it was reasonably priced for a hotel.Jo"
